C002,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,"The non-access stratum (NAS) described in the present document forms the highest stratum of the control plane between UE and MME at the radio interface (reference point ""LTE-Uu""; see 3GPP S 23.401 [10]) Main functions of the protocols that are part of the NAS are the support of mobility of the user equipment (UE); and the support of session management procedures to establish and maintain IP connectivity between the UE and a packet data network gateway (PDN GW) NAS security is an additional function of the NAS providing services to the NAS protocols, e.g. integrity protection and ciphering of NAS signalling messages For the support of the above functions, the following procedures are supplied within this specification elementary procedures for EPS mobility management in clause 5; and elementary procedures for EPS session management in clause 6 Complete NAS transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures. Examples of such specific sequences can be found in 3GPP S 23.401 [10] The NAS for EPS follows the protocol architecture model for layer 3 as described in 3GPP S 24.007 [12]; however, due to the objective of EPS to provide the subscriber with a ""ready-to-use"" IP connectivity and an ""always-on"" experience, the protocol supports a linkage between mobility management and session management procedures during the attach procedure (see clause 4.2) Signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are described as part of the EPS mobility management in clause 5. In addition to that, principles for the handing of EPS security contexts and for the activation of ciphering and integrity protection, when a NAS signalling connection is established, are provided in clause 4.4 .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C003,SERVICE REQUEST,EMM-REGISTERED,"During the EPS attach procedure, the network can activate a default EPS bearer context (i.e. if the UE requests PDN connectivity in the attach request). Additionally, the network can activate one or several dedicated EPS bearer contexts in parallel for PDN connections of IP or Ethernet PDN type. To this purpose the EPS session management messages for the default EPS bearer context activation can be transmitted in an information element in the EPS mobility management messages. In this case, the UE and the network execute the attach procedure, the default EPS bearer context activation procedure, and the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure in parallel. The UE and network shall complete the combined default EPS bearer context activation procedure and the attach procedure before the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is completed. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the success of the attach procedure is dependent on the success of the default EPS bearer context activation procedure. If the attach procedure fails, then the ESM procedures also fail A UE using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization can initiate transport of user data via the control plane. For this purpose a UE in EMM-IDLE mode can initiate the service request procedure and transmit the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in an information element in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure, during EMM procedures the MME shall suspend the transmission of ESM messages.

C016,DETACH REQUEST,EMM-REGISTERED,"The security parameters for authentication, integrity protection and ciphering are tied together in an EPS security context and identified by a key set identifier for E-UTRAN (eKSI). The relationship between the security parameters is defined in 3GPP S 33.401 [19] Before security can be activated, the MME and the UE need to establish an EPS security context. Usually, the EPS security context is created as the result of an EPS authentication procedure between MME and UE. Alternatively during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE derive a mapped EPS security context from a UMTS security context that has been established while the UE was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or during CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE derive a mapped EPS security context from a CS UMTS security context that has been established while the UE was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode The EPS security context is taken into use by the UE and the MME, when the MME initiates a security mode control procedure or during the inter-system handover procedure from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode. The EPS security context which has been taken into use by the network most recently is called current EPS security context. This current EPS security context can be of type native or mapped, i.e. originating from a native EPS security context or mapped EPS security context The key set identifier eKSI is assigned by the MME either during the EPS authentication procedure or, for the mapped EPS security context, during the inter-system handover procedure. The eKSI consists of a value and a type of security context parameter indicating whether an EPS security context is a native EPS security context or a mapped EPS security context. When the EPS security context is a native EPS security context, the eKSI has the value of KSIASME, and when the current EPS security context is of type mapped, the eKSI has the value of KSISGSN The EPS security context which is indicated by an eKSI can be taken into use to establish the secure exchange of NAS messages when a new NAS signalling connection is established without executing a new EPS authentication procedure (see clause 4.4.2.3) or when the MME initiates a security mode control procedure. For this purpose the initial NAS messages (i.e. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, DETACH REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST) and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an eKSI in the NAS key set identifier IE or the value part of eKSI in the KSI and sequence number IE indicating the current EPS security context used to integrity protect the NAS message In the present document, when the UE is required to delete an eKSI, the UE shall set the eKSI to the value ""no key is available"" and consider also the associated keys KASME or K 'ASME, EPS NAS ciphering key and EPS NAS integrity key invalid (i.e. the EPS security context associated with the eKSI as no longer valid) NOTE: In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number might be used instead of the term Key Set Identifier (KSI) The UE and the MME need to be able to maintain two EPS security contexts simultaneously, i.e. a current EPS security context and a non-current EPS security context, since after an EPS re-authentication, the UE and the MME can have both a current EPS security context and a non-current EPS security context which has not yet been taken into use (i.e. a partial native EPS security context); and after an inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the UE and the MME can have both a mapped EPS security context, which is the current EPS security context, and a non-current native EPS security context that was created during a previous access in S1 mode or S101 mode The number of EPS security contexts that need to be maintained simultaneously by the UE and the MME is limited by the following requirements After a successful EPS (re-)authentication, which creates a new partial native EPS security context, the MME and the UE shall delete the non-current EPS security context, if any When a partial native EPS security context is taken into use through a security mode control procedure, the MME and the UE shall delete the previously current EPS security context When the MME and the UE create an EPS security context using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services, or a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services (see clause 5.4.3.2), the MME and the UE shall delete the previous current EPS security context When a new mapped EPS security context or EPS security context created using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm is taken into use during the inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE shall not delete the previously current native EPS security context, if any. Instead, the previously current native EPS security context shall become a non-current native EPS security context, and the MME and the UE shall delete any partial native EPS security context If no previously current native EPS security context exists, the MME and the UE shall not delete the partial native EPS security context, if any When the MME and the UE derive a new mapped EPS security context during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE shall delete any existing current mapped EPS security context When a non-current full native EPS security context is taken into use by a security mode control procedure, then the MME and the UE shall delete the previously current mapped EPS security context When the UE or the MME moves from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED state, if the current EPS security context is a mapped EPS security context and a non-current full native EPS security context exists, then the non-current EPS security context shall become the current EPS security context. Furthermore, the UE and the MME shall delete any mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context The UE shall mark the EPS security context on the USIM or in the non-volatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an attach procedure as described in clause 5.5.1 or when the UE leaves state EMM-DEREGISTERED for any other state except EMM-NULL The UE shall store the current native EPS security context as specified in annex C and mark it as valid only when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED from any other state except EMM-NULL or when the UE aborts the attach procedure without having left EMM-DEREGISTERED .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C018,SERVICE REQUEST,IDLE,"Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is usually established by the MME during the attach procedure by initiating a security mode control procedure.

After successful completion of the procedure, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in clause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered 3) If the UE has no current EPS security context and performs a tracking area updating procedure after an inter-system change in idle mode from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the UE shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message without integrity protection and encryption. The UE shall include a nonce and a GPRS ciphering key sequence number for creation of a mapped EPS security context. The MME creates a fresh mapped EPS security context and takes this context into use by initiating a security mode control procedure and this context becomes the current EPS security context in both the UE and the MME. This re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages 4) If the initial NAS message is a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the UE shall send the message integrity protected. If an ESM message container information element or a NAS message container information element is included the message shall be sent partially ciphered (see clause 4.4.5), otherwise the message shall be sent unciphered.

The NAS COUNT counters use 24 bit internal representation and are independently maintained by UE and MME. The NAS COUNT shall be constructed as a NAS sequence number (8 least significant bits) concatenated with a NAS overflow counter (16 most significant bits) When NAS COUNT is input to NAS ciphering or NAS integrity algorithms it shall be considered to be a 32-bit entity which shall be constructed by padding the 24-bit internal representation with 8 zeros in the most significant bits The value of the uplink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annex C, is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message The value of the downlink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annex C, is the largest downlink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message The value of the uplink NAS COUNT stored in the MME is the largest uplink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message The value of the downlink NAS COUNT stored in the MME is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message The NAS sequence number part of the NAS COUNT shall be exchanged between the UE and the MME as part of the NAS signalling.

The receiving side shall estimate the NAS COUNT used by the sending side. Specifically, if the estimated NAS sequence number wraps around, the NAS overflow counter shall be incremented by one NOTE 0: When estimating a NAS COUNT, the receiver is required to ensure that a given NAS COUNT value is accepted at most one time, as specified in clause 4.4.3.2 After the derivation of a NAS token due to an inter-system change from S1mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode in idle mode as specified in 3GPP S 24.008 [13], the UE shall increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one When the MME receives a NAS token via SGSN during an idle mode inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, the MME shall check the NAS token as specified in 3GPP S 33.401 [19], clause 9.1.1, and update its uplink NAS COUNT with the uplink NAS COUNT value used for the successful check of the NAS token NOTE 1: The MME does not check the NAS token if it is received via SGSN during a connected mode inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode During the handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, when a mapped EPS security context is derived and taken into use, the MME shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this EPS security context to zero.

C138,SERVICE REQUEST,EMM-REGISTERED,"CIoT EPS optimizations provide improved support of small data and SMS transfer. A UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations can indicate the CIoT network behaviour the UE can support and prefers to use during attach or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP S 23.401 [10]). The UE may indicate the support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization, user plane CIoT EPS optimization, EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, S1-U data transfer and header compression (see clause 9.9.3.34). The UE may also request to use SMS transfer without combined attach procedure during the attach procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization (see clause 9.9.3.0B). The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use. A UE supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations can also indicate the 5GS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support during attach or tracking area updating procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization NOTE 1: The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization and S1-U data transfer but not user plane CIoT EPS optimization does not indicate preference for user plane CIoT EPS optimization The UE can be in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimizations during an attach or tracking area updating procedure. A UE in NB-S1 mode always indicates support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization. A UE in NB-S1 mode can also request SMS transfer without combined procedure by using the normal attach or tracking area updating procedure (see clause 5.5.1 and 5.5.3) In NB-S1 mode, the UE, when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimization, does not request an attach for emergency bearer services procedure request an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to ""EPS emergency attach"" indicate voice domain preference and UE 's usage setting; or request an attach for access to RLOS The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency bearer services when the UE is in NB-S1 mode (see clause 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.3.2.4) The control plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support of efficient transport of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet) or SMS messages over control plane via the MME without triggering data radio bearer establishment. The support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization is mandatory for the network in NB-S1 mode and optional in WB-S1 mode. Optional header compression of IP data can be applied to IP PDN type PDN connections that are configured to support header compression The user plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support for change from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode without the need for using the service request procedure (see clause 5.3.1.3) If the UE indicates support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the attach request, the UE may include an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE instead of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as part of the attach procedure. If the EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the network, the UE and the network can at any time release all the PDN connections and the UE still remains EPS attached NOTE 2: For both the UE and the network, the term ""EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection"" is equivalent to the term ""EPS attach without PDN connectivity"" as specified in 3GPP S 23.401 [10] In NB-S1 mode, if the UE indicates ""SMS only"" during a normal attach or tracking area updating procedure, the MME supporting CIoT EPS optimisations provides SMS so that the UE is not required to perform a combined attach or tracking area updating procedure If the UE supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support S1-U data transfer If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and the network supports one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and decides to accept the attach or tracking area update request, the network indicates the supported CIoT EPS optimizations to the UE per TAI list when accepting the UE request. Network indication of support is interpreted by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature.

Otherwise, the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is not supported If the UE indicates support of the reject paging request in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the reject paging request, then the MME shall set the reject paging request bit to ""reject paging request supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support of the paging restriction in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the MME sets the reject paging request bit to ""reject paging request supported"" the NAS signalling connection release bit to ""NAS signalling connection release supported""; or both of them in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message, and the network decides to accept the paging restriction, then the MME shall set the paging restriction bit to ""paging restriction supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support of the paging timing collision control in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging timing collision control, then the MME shall set the paging timing collision control bit to ""paging timing collision control supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message If the MUSIM UE has included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message and if the MME supports paging timing collision control, the MME shall include the Negotiated IMSI offset IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, and the MME shall set the IMSI offset value to A value that is different than what the UE has provided, if the MME has a different value; or A value that is same as what the UE has provided, if the MME does not have a different value and the MME shall calculate an alternative IMSI value using the IMSI offset value and store it in the UE context as specified in 3GPP S 23.401 [10]. The alternative IMSI value is used for deriving the paging occasion as specified in 3GPP S 36.304 [21] If the MUSIM UE has not included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME shall erase any stored alternative IMSI value for that UE, if available If due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall set the redir-policy bit to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed"" in the Network policy IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message The MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the ATTACH ACCEPT message if the UE has indicated support for service gap control; and a service gap time value is available in the EMM context If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the ATTACH REQUEST message, then the MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to ""Signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message Upon receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3410 The GUTI reallocation may be part of the attach procedure. When the ATTACH REQUEST message includes the IMSI or IMEI, or the MME considers the GUTI provided by the UE is invalid, or the GUTI provided by the UE was assigned by another MME, the MME shall allocate a new GUTI to the UE. The MME shall include in the ATTACH ACCEPT message the new assigned GUTI together with the assigned TAI list. In this case the MME shall enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in clause 5.4.1 For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP S 23.251 [8B]) If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as the new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old GUTI and store the new assigned GUTI. If no GUTI has been included by the MME in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old GUTI, if any available, shall be kept If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported in the UE, the UE shall set its TIN to ""GUTI"" when receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the value in T3412 extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412) If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE shall use the included timer value for T3324 as specified in 3GPP S 24.008 [13], clause 4.7.2.8 If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the MUSIM UE shall forward the IMSI offset value to lower layers. If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the MUSIM UE shall indicate to lower layers to erase any IMSI offset value, if available The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the attach procedure is neither for emergency bearer services nor for access to RLOS, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of ""forbidden PLMNs"" or in the list of ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"". In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP S 23.401 [10], and determines that any but not all TAIs in the received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service as per operator 's choice, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of ""Forbidden tracking areas for roaming"" IE b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of ""Forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"" IE; or in the ATTACH ACCEPT message NOTE 8: ""Forbidden tracking areas for roaming"" corresponds to cause values #13 and #15, and ""Forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"" corresponds to cause value #12 If the attach procedure is neither for emergency bearer services nor for access to RLOS, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of ""forbidden PLMNs"" or the list of ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s) The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS), emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network feature support information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP S 23.221 [8A], clause 7.2a and clause 7.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain selection. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE 's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified in 3GPP S 24.171 [13C] If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to ""Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with NR is restricted to the upper layers The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system interworking with 5GS as follows if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to ""interworking without N26 interface not supported"", the UE shall operate in single-registration mode if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to ""interworking without N26 interface supported"" and the UE supports dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or NOTE 9: The registration mode used by the UE is implementation dependent if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to ""interworking without N26 interface supported"" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration mode The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs. The interworking procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface are specified in 3GPP S 24.501 [54] If the redir-policy bit is set to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed"" in the Network policy IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed"" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed. If the redir-policy bit is set to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed"" or if the Network policy IE is not included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy for the current PLMN to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed"" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is allowed. The UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed"" and indicate this to the lower layers when any of the following events occurs the UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in a PLMN different from the PLMN where the UE performed the last successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure the UE is switched on; or the UICC containing the USIM is removed If the UE has initiated the attach procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives an ATTACH ACCEPT message; and the UE sent the ATTACH REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list When the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE has requested PDN connectivity the UE shall forward the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the ESM sublayer. Upon receipt of an indication from the ESM sublayer that the default EPS bearer context has been activated, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message contained in the ESM message container information element to the network Additionally, the UE shall reset the attach attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container information element to the network If the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see clause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these counters. If the UE maintains a counter for ""SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services"", then the UE shall reset this counter When the UE receives any ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST messages during the attach procedure, and if the UE has requested PDN connectivity the UE shall forward the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message(s) to the ESM sublayer. The UE shall send a response to the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message(s) after successful completion of the attach procedure If the attach procedure was initiated in S101 mode, the lower layers are informed about the successful completion of the procedure Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and consider the GUTI sent in the ATTACH ACCEPT message as valid If the T3448 value IE is present in the received ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3448 if it is running; and start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present If the UE has indicated ""service gap control supported"" in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall store the new T3447 value, erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and use the new T3447 value with the T3447 timer next time it is started; or the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and stop the T3447 timer if running In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to ""RACS supported"" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME may include a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to ""RACS supported"" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to ""Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested"", the UE shall delete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated with the registered PLMN stored at the UE, then the UE shall, after the completion of the ongoing attach procedure, initiate a tracking area updating procedure as specified in clause 5.5.3 over the existing NAS signalling connection; and a UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall store the UE radio capability ID as specified in annex C If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for roaming"" IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for roaming"", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for roaming"" If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"" IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of ""forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"" .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the attach procedure is started again after an implementation dependent time In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for ""originating signalling"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), a request for an exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the attach procedure shall be started NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]) If access is barred because of access class barring for ""originating signalling"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), ACDC is applicable to the request from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), a request with a higher ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), a request with a certain ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started aa) Lower layer failure to establish the RRC connection and the UE is in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to ""EPS emergency attach"" the UE supports being configured with CustomLLFailureRetry as specified in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A]); and CustomLLFailureRetry leaf is present as specified in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A]) The UE shall abort the attach procedure and wait for a UE implementation specific timer which shall be set to MinRetryTimer or MaxRetryTimer as specified in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A]. The UE shall not set the UE implementation specific timer to MinRetryTimer for more than MaxMinRetry consecutive attempts as specified in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A]. After the expiration of the UE implementation specific timer, the UE shall restart the attach procedure, if still needed b) Lower layer failure not covered in case aa) or release of the NAS signalling connection without ""Extended wait time"" and without ""Extended wait time CP data"" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message is received The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as described below The UE shall abort the attach procedure. The NAS signalling connection, if any, shall be released locally NOTE 2: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified in clause 5.4.2.7 The UE shall proceed as described below d) ATTACH REJECT, other EMM cause values than those treated in clause 5.5.1.2.5, and cases of EMM cause values #22, #25, #31 and #78, if considered as abnormal cases according to clause 5.5.1.2.5 Upon reception of the EMM cause #19 ""ESM failure"", if the UE is not configured for NAS signalling low priority and the ESM cause value received in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message is not #54 ""PDN connection does not exist"", the UE may set the attach attempt counter to 5. Subsequently, if the UE needs to retransmit the ATTACH REQUEST message to request PDN connectivity towards a different APN, the UE may stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message. If the UE needs to attempt EPS attach to request transfer of a PDN connection for emergency bearer services by including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to ""handover of emergency bearer services"", the UE shall stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message NOTE 3: When receiving EMM cause #19 ""ESM failure"", coordination is required between the EMM and ESM sublayers in the UE to determine whether to set the attach attempt counter to 5 If the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to ""EPS emergency attach"", upon reception of the EMM causes #95, #96, #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the attach attempt counter to 5 The UE shall proceed as described below e) Change of cell into a new tracking area If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the attach procedure is completed, the attach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. If a tracking area border is crossed when the ATTACH ACCEPT message has been received but before an ATTACH COMPLETE message is sent, the attach procedure shall be re-initiated. If a GUTI was allocated during the attach procedure, this GUTI shall be used in the attach procedure f) Mobile originated detach required The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE initiated detach procedure shall be performed g) Detach procedure collision If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates ""re-attach not required"" and no EMM cause IE, or ""re-attach not required"" and the EMM cause value is not #2 ""IMSI unknown in HSS"", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the attach procedure shall be aborted. If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates ""re-attach required"", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the UE shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before re-initiating the attach procedure. Otherwise the attach procedure shall be progressed and the DETACH REQUEST message shall be ignored h) Transmission failure of ATTACH REQUEST message indication from lower layers The UE shall restart the attach procedure immediately i) Transmission failure of ATTACH COMPLETE message indication from lower layers If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE shall restart the attach procedure If the current TAI is still in the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure. The EMM sublayer notifies the ESM sublayer that the ESM message in the ESM message container IE of the ATTACH COMPLETE has failed to be transmitted j) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall either send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT contained in the ESM message container information element to the network or initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific k) Indication from the lower layers that an S101 mode to S1 mode handover has been cancelled (S101 mode only) The UE shall abort the attach procedure and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE l) ""Extended wait time"" from the lower layers If the ATTACH REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to ""MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority"", the UE shall start timer T3346 with the ""Extended wait time"" value and reset the attach attempt counter If the ATTACH REQUEST message did not contain the low priority indicator set to ""MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority"", the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the ""Extended wait time"" value and reset the attach attempt counter In other cases the UE shall ignore the ""Extended wait time"" The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process The UE shall proceed as described below la) ""Extended wait time CP data"" from the lower layers If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the ""Extended wait time CP data"" value and reset the attach attempt counter In other cases the UE shall ignore the ""Extended wait time CP data"" The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process The UE shall proceed as described below m) Timer T3346 is running The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 15 in selected PLMN the UE needs to attach for emergency bearer services the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and i) the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP S 31.102 [17]); and ii) timer T3346 was not started when NAS signalling connection was established with RRC establishment cause set to ""MO exception data""; or the UE needs to attach without the NAS signalling low priority indication and if the timer T3346 was started due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set to ""MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority"" The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process NOTE 4: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate an attach procedure while timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful case The UE shall proceed as described below n) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE is included in the ESM message container information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container information element to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific o) Timer T3447 is running The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 15 in selected PLMN the UE attempts to attach for emergency bearer services; or the UE attempts to attach without PDN connection request The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach request procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires For the cases b, c, d, l, la and m Timer T3410 shall be stopped if still running For the cases b, c, d, l when the ""Extended wait time"" is ignored, and la when the ""Extended wait time CP data"" is ignored, if the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to ""EPS emergency attach"", the attach attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5 If the attach attempt counter is less than 5 for the cases l, la and m, the attach procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped for the cases b, c, d, l when the ""Extended wait time"" is ignored, and la when the ""Extended wait time CP data"" is ignore, if the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to ""EPS emergency attach"", timer T3411 is started and the state is changed to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. When timer T3411 expires the attach procedure shall be restarted, if still required by ESM sublayer If the attach attempt counter is equal to 5 the UE shall delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of equivalent PLMNs and KSI, shall set the update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall start timer T3402. The state is changed to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH or optionally to EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP S 23.122 [6]; and if A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode is supported by the UE if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP S 24.008 [13] for the abnormal case when a normal attach procedure fails and the attach attempt counter is equal to 5 if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP S 24.501 [54] for the abnormal case when an initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access fails and the registration attempt counter is equal to 5; and the UE shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate GMM or 5GMM specific procedures. Additionally, if the UE selects GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in clause 4.5. If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE (see 3GPP S 24.368 [50] or 3GPP S 31.102 [17]) and the UE selects NG-RAN radio access technology, it shall not disable the E-UTRA capability; otherwise, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in clause 4.5 NOTE 5: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as barred (see 3GPP S 36.304 [21]) is left to the UE implementation .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP S 24.193 [61] is deactivated locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the network shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME except for the case no EPS bearer context exists on the network side If the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates ""periodic updating"", and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location area The MME shall indicate ""combined TA/LA updated"" or ""combined TA/LA updated and ISR activated"" in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates ""periodic updating"" and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services; and location area updating for non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP S 29.118 [16A] is successful The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the UE indicates support of the extended periodic timer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the T3324 value IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the T3412extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing the T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message NOTE 6: Besides the value requested by the MS, the MME can take local configuration or subscription data provided by the HSS into account when selecting a value for T3412 (see 3GPP S 23.401 [10] clause 4.3.17.3) If the MME includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than deactivated in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MME shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated Also, during the tracking area updating procedure without the ""active"" flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message Also, during the tracking area updating procedure with the ""active"" flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) associated with control plane only indication locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the UE is not allowed to access the TA, but it has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure when the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode. When the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME locally deactivates all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts and informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS bearer contexts. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only and shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection, and if a GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP S 36.413 [23]); or no GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer then the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, the MME takes one of the following actions if no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not accept the tracking area update request as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.5 if active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, is accepted by the network, the following different cases can be distinguished 1) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW and if a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP S 36.413 [23]); or no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer 2) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW and if a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the LHN-ID stored in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP S 36.413 [23]); or no LHN-ID value is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer then the MME takes one of the following actions if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure detach the UE by using detach type ""re-attach required"" (see clause 5.5.2.3.1) if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 ""reactivation requested"" for the default EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause 6.4.4.2); and if a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 ""reactivation requested"" for the default EPS bearer context of each SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause 6.4.4.2) For a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the conditions to deactivate ISR are specified in 3GPP S 23.401 [10], clause 4.3.5.6 For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP S 23.251 [8B]) If the ""active"" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts. If the ""active"" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication If the ""signalling active"" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure If the ""active"" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to ""NAS signalling connection release"". If the ""active"" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to ""NAS signalling connection release"" If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, non-IP or Ethernet PDN type, inter-system change with 5GS, UAS services or the network wants to enforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS (see 3GPP S 33.501 [24]), then the MME shall support the extended protocol configuration options IE NOTE 7: Support of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative requirements as specified in 3GPP S 33.401 [19] and it is implemented based on the operator requirement If the MME supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the UE indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to ""extended protocol configuration options supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network decides to restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictEC bit to ""Use of enhanced coverage is restricted"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message The MME may indicate the header compression configuration status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message for each established EPS bearer context using control plane CIoT EPS optimisation If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer, and the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME decides to restrict the use of dual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictDCNR bit to ""Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports inter-system interworking with 5GS, the MME may set the IWK N26 bit to either ""interworking without N26 interface not supported"" if the MME supports N26 interface; or ""interworking without N26 interface supported"" if the MME does not support N26 interface in the EPS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the MME determines the UE 's N1 mode capability for 3GPP access changes from "" N1 mode not supported "" to "" N1 mode supported "" and the network decides to enable the transfer of a PDN connection not supporting interworking to 5GS from S1 mode to N1 mode, the MME may upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure to deactivate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection by including ESM cause #39 ""reactivation requested"" in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message (see clause 6.4.4.2) If due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall set the redir-policy bit to ""Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed"" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE has indicated support for service gap control, a service gap time value is available in the EMM context, the MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to ""Signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support of the NAS signalling connection release in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the NAS signalling connection release, then the MME shall set the NAS signalling connection release bit to ""NAS signalling connection release supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support of the paging indication for voice services in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging indication for voice services, then the MME shall set the paging indication for voice services bit to ""paging indication for voice services supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with the paging indication for voice services bit set to ""paging indication for voice services supported"", the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is supported. Otherwise, the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is not supported If the UE indicates support of the reject paging request in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the reject paging request, then the MME shall set the reject paging request bit to ""reject paging request supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support of the paging restriction in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME sets the reject paging request bit to ""reject paging request supported"" the NAS signalling connection release bit to ""NAS signalling connection release supported""; or both of them in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the network decides to accept the paging restriction, then the MME shall set the paging restriction bit to ""paging restriction supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE indicates support of the paging timing collision control in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging timing collision control, then the MME shall set the paging timing collision control bit to ""paging timing collision control supported"" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME has valid ciphering key data applicable to the UE 's subscription, then the MME shall include the ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging If the MUSIM UE has included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating ""periodic updating"" and if the MME supports paging timing collision control, the MME shall include the Negotiated IMSI offset IE and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the MME shall set the IMSI offset value to A value that is different than what the UE has provided, if the MME has a different value; or A value that is same as what the UE has provided, if the MME does not have a different value and the MME shall calculate an alternative IMSI value using the IMSI offset value and store it in the UE context as specified in 3GPP S 23.401 [10]. The alternative IMSI value is used for deriving the paging occasion as specified in 3GPP S 36.304 [21] If the MUSIM UE has not included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating ""periodic updating"" and the MME has stored an alternative IMSI value for that UE, the MME shall erase the alternative IMSI value and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection, by setting Request type to ""NAS signalling connection release"" in the UE request type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports the NAS signalling connection release, the MME shall initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure. If the UE requests restriction of paging by including the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports the paging restriction, the MME if accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to ""paging restriction is accepted"". The MME shall store the paging restriction of the UE and enforce these restrictions in the paging procedure as described in clause 5.6.2; or if rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to ""paging restriction is rejected"", and shall discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3430, reset the service request attempt counter, tracking area updating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as new temporary identity for EPS services and shall store the new GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE receives a new TAI list in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see clause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these counters. If the UE maintains a counter for ""SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services"", then the UE shall reset this counter If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the T3412 extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT contains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is included, the UE shall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE shall use the timer value for T3324 as specified in 3GPP S 24.008 [13], clause 4.7.2.8 If the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode to perform an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode and the nonceUE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the nonceUE upon receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP S 24.193 [61] is deactivated locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE may choose to ignore all those EPS bearers which are indicated by the MME as being active but are inactive at the UE If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MUSIM UE shall forward the IMSI offset value to lower layers. If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message does not indicate ""periodic updating"", the MUSIM UE shall indicate to lower layers to erase any IMSI offset value, if available The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if there is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services or PDN connection for RLOS established, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of ""forbidden PLMNs"" or in the list of ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"". If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of forbidden PLMNs or in the list of ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"" when the PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released. In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list If the UE is neither attached for emergency bearer services nor attached for access to RLOS, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of ""forbidden PLMNs"" or the list of ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s) The network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is active. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains i) no indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to ""GUTI"" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running ii) an indication that ISR is activated, then if the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in 3GPP S 24.008 [13], annex P.5, the UE shall set the TIN to ""GUTI"" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in UE network capability or change in DRX parameters, the UE s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP S 23.221 [8A], clause 7.2a and clause 7.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support IMS voice over PS sessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any persistent EPS bearer context. When the UE determines via the emergency bearer services indicator that the network does not support emergency bearer services in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any emergency EPS bearer context if there is a radio bearer associated with that context. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE 's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified in 3GPP S 24.171 [13C] If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP S 23.401 [10], and determines that any but not all TAIs in the received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service as per operator 's choice," the MME shall include the TAI(s) in a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of """"forbidden tracking areas for roaming"""" IE b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of """"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"""" IE; or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message NOTE 8: """"Forbidden tracking areas for roaming"""" corresponds to cause values #13 and #15"," and """"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service"""" corresponds cause value #12 If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to """"Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted"""" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message"," the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with NR is restricted to the upper layers The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system interworking with 5GS as follows if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to """"interworking without N26 interface not supported"""""," the UE shall operate in single-registration mode if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to """"interworking without N26 interface supported"""" and the UE supports dual-registration mode"," the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or NOTE 9: The registration mode used by the UE is implementation dependent if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to """"interworking without N26 interface supported"""" and the UE only supports single-registration mode"," the UE shall operate in single-registration mode The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs.

C256,SERVICE REQUEST PROCEDURE (PART 1) NOTE 1: SECURITY PROTECTED NAS MESSAGE: THIS COULD BE E.G.,EMM-DEREGISTERED,"The purpose of the service request procedure is to transfer the EMM mode from EMM-IDLE to EMM-CONNECTED mode. If the UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, this procedure is used to establish the radio and S1 bearers when user data or signalling is to be sent. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, this procedure can be used for UE initiated transfer of user data via the control plane. Another purpose of this procedure is to invoke MO/MT CS fallback or 1xCS fallback procedures This procedure is used when the network has downlink signalling pending the UE has uplink signalling pending the UE or the network has user data pending and the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and has a NAS signalling connection only;

C296,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,"This clause describes the procedures used for EPS session management (ESM) at the radio interface (reference point ""LTE-Uu"") The main function of the ESM sublayer is to support the EPS bearer context handling in the UE and in the MME The ESM comprises procedures for the activation, deactivation and modification of EPS bearer contexts the request for resources (IP connectivity to a PDN or dedicated bearer resources) by the UE; and the transport of user data via the control plane between the UE and the MME Each EPS bearer context represents an EPS bearer between the UE and a PDN. EPS bearer contexts can remain activated even if the radio and S1 bearers constituting the corresponding EPS bearers between UE and MME are temporarily released An EPS bearer context can be either a default bearer context or a dedicated bearer context A default EPS bearer context is activated when the UE requests a connection to a PDN Generally, ESM procedures can be performed only if an EMM context has been established between the UE and the MME, and the secure exchange of NAS messages has been initiated by the MME by use of the EMM procedures described in clause 5. The first default EPS bearer context, however, can be activated during the EPS attach procedure (see clause 4.2). Once the UE is successfully attached, and the first default EPS bearer context has been activated during or after the attach procedure, the UE can request the MME to set up connections to additional PDNs. For each additional connection, the MME will activate a separate default EPS bearer context. A default EPS bearer context remains activated throughout the lifetime of the connection to the PDN A dedicated EPS bearer context is always linked to a default EPS bearer context and represents additional EPS bearer resources between the UE and the PDN. The network can initiate the activation of dedicated EPS bearer contexts together with the activation of the default EPS bearer context or at any time later, as long as the default EPS bearer context remains activated. However, the network shall not initiate a dedicated bearer context activation procedure for established PDN connection(s) of ""non IP"" PDN type Default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be modified. Dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be released without affecting the default EPS bearer context. When the default EPS bearer context is released, then all dedicated EPS bearer contexts linked to it are released too The UE can request the network to allocate, modify or release EPS bearer resources. The network can fulfil such a request from the UE by activating a new dedicated EPS bearer context, modifying an EPS bearer context or deactivating an EPS bearer context .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If more than one back-off timers for the same PLMN and APN combination was started in N1 mode with an indication from the network that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed and no back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until all timers have expired. If at least one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed NOTE 3: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp NOTE 4: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation.

Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating access 2. Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network 3. Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or 4. Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network b) a table listing the Information Elements (IE) known in the message and the order of their appearance in the message. All IEs that may be repeated are explicitly indicated (The V, LV and LV-E formatted IEs, which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before the T, TV, TLV and TLV-E formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of the message, see 3GPP S 24.007 [12]). In a (maximal) sequence of consecutive IEs with half octet length, the first IE with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second IE bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third IE bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a sequence always has an even number of elements For each information element the table indicates 1. The Information Element Identifier (IEI), in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has format T, TV, TLV or TLVE.

Each of these feature groups meets certain threats and accomplishes certain security objectives - Network access security (I): the set of security features that provide users with secure access to services, and which in particular protect against attacks on the (radio) access link - Network domain security (II): the set of security features that enable nodes to securely exchange signalling data, user data (between AN and SN and within AN)," and protect against attacks on the wireline network - User domain security (III): the set of security features that secure access to mobile stations - Application domain security (IV): the set of security features that enable applications in the user and in the provider domain to securely - Visibility and configurability of security (V): the set of features that enables the user to inform himself whether a security feature is in operation or not and whether the use and provision of services should depend on the security feature NOTE 1: Relay nodes are not explicitly shown in Figure 4-1. They combine the functionalities of ME and AN in a way described in TS 36.300 [30]. The present document describes how to apply security features NOTE 2: There is an option for some uplink and downlink user data to be sent via the MME.

It also includes a KSIASME for the ME which will be used to identify the KASME (and further keys derived from the KASME) that results from the EPS AKA procedure At receipt of this message, the USIM shall verify the freshness of the authentication vector by checking whether AUTN can be accepted as described in TS 33.102[4]. If so, the USIM computes a response RES. USIM shall compute CK and IK which are sent to the ME. If the USIM computes a Kc (i.e GPRS Kc) from CK and IK using conversion function c3 as described in TS 33.102 [4], and sends it to the ME, then the ME shall ignore such GPRS Kc and not store the GPRS Kc on USIM or in ME. If the verification fails, the USIM indicates to the ME the reason for failure and in the case of a synchronisation failure passes the AUTS parameter (see TS 33.102 [4]) An ME accessing E-UTRAN shall check during authentication that the ""separation bit"" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 1. The ""separation bit"" is bit 0 of the AMF field of AUTN NOTE 3: This separation bit in the AMF can not be used anymore for operator specific purposes as described by TS 33.102 [4], Annex F NOTE 4: If the keys CK, IK resulting from an EPS AKA run were stored in the fields already available on the USIM for storing keys CK and IK this could lead to overwriting keys resulting from an earlier run of UMTS AKA. This would lead to problems when EPS security context and UMTS security context were held simultaneously (as is the case when security context is stored e.g. for the purposes of Idle Mode Signaling Reduction). Therefore, ""plastic roaming"" where a UICC is inserted into another ME will necessitate an EPS AKA authentication run if the USIM does not support EMM parameters storage UE shall respond with User authentication response message including RES in case of successful AUTN verification and successful AMF verification as described above. In this case the ME shall compute KASME from CK, IK, and serving network's identity (SN id) using the KDF as specified in clause A.2. SN id binding implicitly authenticates the serving network's identity when the derived keys from KASME are successfully used NOTE 5: This does not preclude a USIM (see TS 31.102 [13]) in later releases having the capability of deriving KASME Otherwise UE shall send an authentication failure message with a CAUSE value indicating the reason for failure. In case of a synchronisation failure of AUTN (as described in TS 33.102 [4]), the UE also includes AUTS that was provided by the USIM. Upon receipt of an authentication failure message, the MME may initiate further identity requests and authentications towards the UE. (see TS 24.301 [9]) The MME checks that the RES equals XRES. If so the authentication is successful. If not, depending on type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message, the MME may initiate further identity requests or send an authentication reject message towards the UE (see TS 24.301 [9]) Figure 6.1.1-1 describes EPS AKA procedure, which is based on UMTS AKA (see TS 33.102[4]).

C915,SERVICE REQUEST,AUTHENTICATED,"NOTE 1: Authentication data in this clause stands for EPS Authentication The purpose of this procedure is to provide the MME with one or more EPS authentication vectors (RAND, AUTN, XRES, KASME) from the user's HE (HSS) to perform user authentication. Each EPS authentication vector can be used to authenticate the UE NOTE 2: It is recommended that the MME fetch only one EPS authentication vector at a time as the need to perform AKA runs has been reduced in EPS through the use of a more elaborate key hierarchy. In particular, service requests can be authenticated using a stored KASME without the need to perform AKA. Furthermore, the sequence number management schemes in TS 33.102, Annex C [4], designed to avoid re-synchronisation problems caused by interleaving use of batches of authentication vectors, are only optional. Re synchronisation problems in EPS can be avoided, independently of the sequence number management scheme, by immediately using an authentication vector retrieved from the HSS in an authentication procedure between UE and MME Figure 6.1.2-1: Distribution of authentication data from HE to MME An EPS authentication vector is derived from the authentication vector defined in TS 33.102 [4] clause 6.3.2. To derive the key KASME in the HE the KDF as specified in clause A.2 is used which shall contain following mandatory input parameters: CK, IK and SN identity If the Network Type equals E-UTRAN then the ""separation bit"" in the AMF field of AUTN shall be set to 1 to indicate to the UE that the authentication vector is only usable for AKA in an EPS context, if the ""separation bit"" is set to 0, the vector is usable in a non-EPS context only (e.g. GSM, UMTS). For authentication vectors with the ""separation bit"" set to 1, the secret keys CK and IK generated during AKA shall never leave The MME invokes the procedures by requesting authentication vectors from the HE (Home environment) The authentication data request shall include the IMSI, the Serving Network identity i.e. MCC + MNC, and the Network Type (i.e. E-UTRAN). In the case of a synchronisation failure, the MME shall also include RAND and AUTS. In this case the HE checks the AUTS parameter before sending new authentication vectors to the MME (see TS 33.102 [4]) Upon the receipt of the authentication data request from the MME, the HE may have pre-computed the required number of EPS authentication vectors and retrieve them from the HSS database or may compute them on demand NOTE 3: For KASME the possibilities for pre-computation are restricted due to the PLMN-binding NOTE 4: The HSS needs to ensure that the MME requesting the authentication data is entitled to use the SN id used to calculate KASME. The exact details of how to achieve this are not covered in The HE sends an authentication response back to the MME that contains the requested information.

The detailed specification is provided in clauses 7.2.8.3 and 7.2.8.4 Whenever an initial AS security context needs to be established between UE and eNB, MME and the UE shall derive a KeNB and a Next Hop parameter (NH) The KeNB and the NH are derived from the KASME. A NH Chaining Counter (NCC) is associated with each KeNB and NH parameter. Every KeNB is associated with the NCC corresponding to the NH value from which it was derived. At initial setup, the KeNB is derived directly from KASME, and is then considered to be associated with a virtual NH parameter with NCC value equal to zero. At initial setup, the derived NH value is associated with the NCC value one NOTE 1: At the UE, the NH derivation associated with NCC=1 could be delayed until the first handover performing vertical key Whether the MME sends the KeNB key or the {NH, NCC} pair to the serving eNB is described in detail in clauses 7.2.8.3 and 7.2.8.4. The MME shall not send the NH value to eNB at the initial connection setup. The eNB shall initialize the NCC value to zero after receiving S1-AP Initial Context NOTE 2: Since the MME does not send the NH value to eNB at the initial connection setup, the NH value associated with the NCC value one can not be used in the next X2 handover or the next intra-eNB handover, for the next X2 handover or the next intra-eNB handover the horizontal key derivation (see Figure 7.2.8.1-1) will apply NOTE 3: One of the rules specified for the MME in clause 7.2.8.4 of this specification states that the MME always computes a fresh {NH, NCC} pair that is given to the target eNB. An implication of this is that the first {NH, NCC} pair will never be used to derive a KeNB It only serves as an initial value for the NH chain The UE and the eNB use the KeNB to secure the communication between each other. On handovers, the basis for the KeNB that will be used between the UE and the target eNB, called KeNB*, is derived from either the currently active KeNB or from the NH parameter.

C978,ESTABLISHMENT IN THE RRC CONNECTION RESUME REQUEST MESSAGE: THE RESUME ID AND A SHORTRESUMEMAC-I.,UNKNOWN,"When the UE decides to resume the RRC connection, the UE sends the RRC Connection Resume Request message on SRB0 and hence it is not integrity protected. The ShortResumeMAC-I is a message authentication token, which shall be calculated with the following inputs: source C-RNTI, source PCI, resume constant and target Cell-ID as defined by VarShortResumeMAC-Input in TS 36.331 [21] and using the stored KRRCint used with the source eNB where the UE was suspended The Resume ID was assigned to the UE in the cell where the UE was suspended (the source cell). The source PCI and source C-RNTI are associated with the cell where the UE was suspended. The target Cell-ID is the identity of the target cell where the UE sends the RRC Connection Resume Request message The resume constant allows differentiation of VarShortResumeMAC from VarShortMAC. The integrity algorithm shall be the negotiated EIA-algorithm from the stored AS security context from the source eNB - KEY shall be set to KRRCint of the source cell - all BEARER bits shall be set to 1 - DIRECTION bit shall be set to 1 - all COUNT bits shall be set to 1 The ShortResumeMAC-I shall be the 16 least significant bits of the output of the used integrity algorithm The target eNB extracts the Resume ID and ShortResumeMAC-I from the RRC Connection Resume Request. The target eNB contacts the source eNB based on the information in the Resume ID by sending a Retrieve UE Context Request message on X2 interface including the Resume ID, the ShortResumeMAC-I and Cell-ID of target cell, in order to retrieve the UE context including the The source eNB retrieves the stored UE context including the AS security context from its database identified by the Resume ID and the source eNB calculates and verifies the ShortResumeMAC-I (calculating it in the same way as described above). If the check of the ShortResumeMAC-I is successful, then the source eNB shall derive a new KeNB* as described in Annex A.5 based on the target PCI and target EARFCN-DL. The source eNB can obtain the target PCI and target EARFCN-DL from a cell configuration database by means of the target Cell-ID. If the source eNB has a fresh {NH NCC} pair from the MME then that pair shall be used and the fresh NH shall be used as in the new KeNB* derivation. The source eNB responds with a Retrieve UE Context Response message to the target eNB on X2 interface including the UE context including the AS security context. The AS security context sent to the target eNB shall include the new derived KeNB*, the NCC associated to the KeNB*, the UE EPS security capabilities including the security algorithms supported by the UE and ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the source cell. The target eNB shall check if it supports the ciphering and integrity algorithms used in the source cell. If this is not the case, the target eNB shall send an appropriate error message to the UE. If the check is successful the target eNB derives new AS keys (RRC integrity key, RRC encryption key and UP keys) corresponding to the algorithms from the received KeNB*, reset all PDCP COUNTs to 0 and activates the new keys in PDCP layer. The target eNB responds with a RRC Connection Resume message including the NCC received from source eNB to the UE on SRB1, integrity protected in PDCP layer using the new AS keys. The RRC Connection Resume message may include RRC connection reconfiguration parameters as defined in TS 36.300 [30] When the UE receives the RRC Connection Resume message, then the UE shall check if the received NCC value is different from the current NCC value stored in the UE itself. If the NCC values differ then the UE needs to synchronize its locally kept NH as defined in Annex A.4. The UE then calculates a new KeNB* from either the new NH (if a new NCC value was received) or the current KeNB*, using the target cell's PCI and its frequency EARFCN-DL in the target cell. The UE performs then further derivation of the AS keys (RRC integrity key, RRC encryption key and UP keys) from the new derived KeNB*. The UE checks the integrity of the RRC Connection Resume message by verifying the MAC-I. If the verification of the MAC-I is successful, then the UE resets all PDCP COUNTs to 0 and activates the new AS keys in PDCP layer and then sends the RRC Connection Resume Complete message both integrity protected and ciphered to the target Security is fully resumed on UE side after reception and processing of RRC connection resume message. The UE can receive data on DRB(s) after having received and processed RRC connection resume message. UL data on DRB(s) can be sent after RRC Connection Resume Complete message After a successful resume the target eNB shall perform Path Switch procedure as is done in case of X2-handover When EDT feature is used, the following handling shall apply to the RRC Connection Resume procedure. For protection of the UL EDT data in the RRC Connection Resume Request message and all other RRC messages following the RRC Connection Resume Request message except RRC Connection Reject, the UE and the source eNB shall derive a new KeNB*. This new KeNB* shall be derived using the target PCI, target EARFCN-DL and the KeNB/NH based on either a horizontal key derivation or a vertical key derivation (as defined in Clause 7.2.8.1.1 and Annex A.5) according to the NCC value sent to the UE in the RRC Connection Suspend message. The UE and the target eNB shall further derive new AS keys KRRCint, KRRCenc, and KUPenc from the newly derived KeNB*. The UE and the target eNB shall use the newly derived KUPenc for ciphering/deciphering of the UL EDT data in PDCP layer in the RRC Connection Resume Request message, and user DL data (if included) in PDCP layer in the RRC Connection Suspend or RRC Connection Resume message. The calculation and verification of the ShortResumeMAC-I shall use the (old) KRRCint used in the source cell Further, in case of EDT, the RRC Connection Resume message sent by the target eNB to the UE shall be both integrity protected and ciphered in PDCP layer using the new AS keys (KRRCint, KRRCenc) derived from the new KeNB* In this case, the UE shall ignore the NCC value in RRC Connection Resume message and shall not change its KeNB. The UE may receive an RRC Connection Reject message with suspend indication, instead of RRC Connection Resume message.

This value of KSISGSN may be different from the KSI pointing to the set of keys most recently generated in UTRAN as an UMTS AKA run may have happened in UTRAN after the current mapped EPS NAS security context indicated by the eKSI with the value KSISGSN was generated NOTE 3: The UE has a current EPS NAS security context in the following scenario: a UE established a current EPS NAS security context during a previous visit to EPS, then moves to UTRAN/GERAN from E UTRAN and storing the current EPS NAS security context. When the UE moves back to E-UTRAN there is a current EPS NAS security context If a current EPS NAS security context is not available in the UE, the UE shall send the TAU request unprotected If the MME received a P-TMSI signature from the UE, the MME shall include that P-TMSI signature in the Context Request message sent to the SGSN. The SGSN shall transfer CK || IK to MME in the Context Response/SGSN Context Response message. In case the MM context in the Context Response/SGSN Context Response indicates GSM security mode, the MME shall abort the In case the TAU Request was protected and the MME has the indicated EPS NAS security context it shall verify the TAU Request message. If it is successful, the UE and the MME share a current EPS NAS security context. In case the TAU Request had the active flag set or the MME chooses to establish radio bearers when there is pending downlink UP data or pending downlink signalling, KeNB is calculated as described If the MME wants to change the algorithms, the MME shall use a NAS security mode procedure (see clause 7.2.4.4) If the MME does not have the EPS NAS security context indicated by the eKSI by the UE in the TAU request, or the TAU request was received unprotected the MME shall create a new mapped EPS NAS security context (that shall become the current EPS NAS security context). In this case, the MME shall generate a 32bit NONCEMME (see clause A.10 for requirements on the randomness of NONCEMME). and use the received NONCEUE with the NONCEMME to generate a fresh mapped K'ASME from CK and IK, where CK, IK were identified by the KSI and P-TMSI in the TAU Request. See Annex A.11 for more information on how to derive the fresh K'ASME. The MME initiates a NAS Security mode command procedure with the UE as described in clause 7.2.4.4 including the KSISGSN, NONCEUE, and NONCEMME in the NAS Security mode command. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT for mapped EPS NAS security context shall be set to start value (i.e., 0) when new mapped EPS NAS security context is created in UE and MME If the TAU Request had the active flag set or the MME chooses to establish radio bearers when there is pending downlink UP data or pending downlink signalling, the uplink NAS Count which is set to zero shall be used to derive the KeNB in MME and UE as specified in clause A.3. MME shall deliver the KeNB to the target eNB on the S1 interface The TAU Accept shall be protected using the current EPS NAS security .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C1003,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,"NAS and AS security shall always be activated before handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN can take place. Consequently the source system in the handover shall always send a key set to the target system during handover. The security policy of the target PLMN determines the selected algorithms to be used within the UTRAN HO command NOTE : The security activation in target system is not the same as handover within E-UTRAN. Only the ciphering algorithm is indicated within the UTRAN HO command. The confidentiality protection begins immediately upon UE reception of the UTRAN HO command while the integrity protection in UTRAN is activated by SMC procedure following the handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN. Further details are in TS 25.331 [24] The MME shall select the current NAS downlink COUNT value to use in the handover and then increase the stored NAS downlink COUNT value by 1 NOTE 0: Increasing the NAS downlink COUNT by 1 is to ensure that a fresh NAS downlink COUNT is used for any future purposes UE and MME shall derive a confidentiality key CK', and an integrity key IK' from the KASME and the selected NAS downlink COUNT value of the current EPS key security context with the help of a one-way key derivation function KDF as specified in clause A.8 Whether UTRAN PS key ciphering is considered active in the target UTRAN after handover from E-UTRAN shall be determined according to the principles for handover to UTRAN in TS 25.331 [24] UE and MME shall assign the value of eKSI to KSI. MME shall transfer CK' || IK' with KSI to SGSN. The target SGSN shall replace all stored parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any, with CK' , IK', KSI received from the MME. The UE shall replace all stored parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any, with CK' , IK' KSI in both ME and USIM. STARTPS shall comply with the rules in TS 25.331 [24]. The ME shall use CK' and IK' to derive the GPRS Kc using the c3 function specified in TS 33.102 [4]. The ME shall assign the eKSI value (associated with CK' and IK') to the GPRS CKSN. The ME shall update the USIM and ME with the GPRS Kc and GPRS CKSN NOTE 1: The new mapped UMTS security context (including CK', and IK') replacing the stored values in the USIM and ME, is for allowing to reuse the mapped UMTS security context without invoking the authentication procedure in subsequent connection set-ups, and also for avoiding that one KSI value gets associated with two different key sets and consequently leads to UMTS security context NOTE 2: An operator concerned about the security of keys received from an E-UTRAN of another operator may want to enforce a policy in SGSN to run a UMTS AKA as soon as possible after the handover. One example of ensuring this is the deletion of the mapped UMTS security context in the SGSN after the UE has left active state in NOTE 3: Due to replacing all the UTRAN PS key parameters CK, IK, KSI with CK', IK' and eKSI on USIM and in ME, a new GPRS Kc needs to be derived from the new UTRAN PS key parameters CK and IK (i.e. CK' and IK'), which is part of the new UMTS security context as well as any old GPRS Kc stored on USIM and in ME, belongs to an old UMTS security context and can no longer be taken into use After HO from E-UTRAN to UTRAN the current EPS NAS security context shall (if it is kept) be considered as the current one in E-UTRAN in the UE and MME shall also provide at least the 4 LSB of the selected NAS downlink COUNT value to the source eNB, which then shall include the bits in the MobilityFromE-UTRANCommand to the UE. The UE shall use the received 4 LSB and its stored NAS downlink COUNT to estimate the NAS downlink COUNT selected by the MME NOTE 4: It is left to the implementation how to estimate the NAS The UE shall ensure that the estimated NAS downlink COUNT has not been used to calculate a CK' and IK' in a previous successful or unsuccessful PS or SRVCC handover. If the estimated NAS downlink COUNT is greater than all the estimated NAS downlink COUNTs either used by the UE for key derivation in a handover or received in a NAS message that passed its integrity check, the UE shall update its stored NAS downlink COUNT as though it has successfully integrity checked a NAS message with that estimated NAS downlink COUNT. In particular, the stored NAS downlink COUNT shall never be decreased MME shall transfer the UE security capabilities to the SGSN. The selection of the algorithms in the target system proceeds as described in TS 33.102 If the handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped UMTS security context can not be used in the future.

C1005,ATTACH REQUEST,EMM-DEREGISTERED,"The procedure for handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN, as far as relevant for security, proceeds in the following two consecutive steps A) Handover signalling using the mapped EPS security context (cf. also B) Subsequent NAS signalling to determine whether a native EPS security context can be taken in use (not shown in Figure 9.2.2.1-1) In this procedure, the START values shall be kept in the volatile memory of the ME, cf. also clause 6.8.11 of TS 33.102 [4] The activation of NAS and AS security in E-UTRAN, and selection of the key set from the source system for the handover shall be according to following i) As described for inter-SGSN PS handover cases in TS 33.102 [4], the source SGSN shall select the key set most recently generated (either by a successful UMTS AKA run in UTRAN (which may or may not yet have been taken into use by the UE and SGSN) or a UMTS security context mapped from an EPS security context during a previous visit to UTRAN) and transfer this key set to the MME in the Forward Relocation Request NOTE 0: The MME is considered as a target SGSN in case of Gn/Gp ii) Activation of AS security (for details cf. TS 36.331 [21]) The E-UTRAN HO command received at the UE shall activate AS security The HO Complete received at the eNB shall activate AS security iii) Activation of NAS security (for details cf. TS 24.301 [9]) The E-UTRAN HO command received at the UE shall activate NAS security The HO Notify received at the MME shall activate NAS security. In case the MME does not have the UE security capabilities stored from a previous visit, then no NAS message shall be sent or accepted by the MME other than a TAU request before a successful check of the UE security capabilities in the TAU request was performed by the MME iv) Both AS and NAS ciphering and integrity protection algorithms shall be selected according to the policy of the target PLMN The above four principles consequentially always activate ciphering (potentially NULL ciphering) in E-UTRAN even if it was not active in the Figure 9.2.2.1-1: Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN A) Handover signalling in case of successful handover Before attempting a handover for a UE, the source RNC may check if the UE is authenticated using UMTS AKA. If the UE is not authenticated using UMTS AKA and the UE does not have an ongoing emergency call, then the source RNC may decide not to perform a handover to E-UTRAN (to avoid triggering unnecessary handover attempts to E-UTRAN which will be rejected by the target MME). The check can be performed by analysing the active CK and IK - If the 64 most significant bits of the CK are not identical to the 64 least significant bits of the CK, the RNC can deduce that the UE was authenticated via UMTS AKA. (The bits are identical if the CK is derived from a Kc via the c4 key conversion function [4], and it is very unlikely that they are equal for a CK derived from UMTS AKA.) - If the 64 most significant bits of the CK are identical to the 64 list significant bits of the CK, the RNC can further check if the IK fulfils the equation given by the c5 key conversion function [4]. If the IK does not fulfil this equation, the RNC can deduce that the UE was authenticated with UMTS AKA, and if the IK does, then the RNC can deduce that the UE was authenticated using GSM AKA If the source RNC does not conclude that the UE is authenticated using UMTS AKA, the source RNC may select an appropriate network for the UE at the handover decision stage and may send a Relocation Required message to the SGSN. This message does not contain any security-relevant parameters 1. The SGSN shall transfer MM context (including CK and IK (or the Kc) KSI and the UE security capabilities) to MME in the Forward relocation request message. In case the MM context in the Forward relocation request message indicates GSM security mode(i.e., it contains a Kc) the MME shall abort the non-emergency call procedure. The UE security capabilities, including the UE EPS security capabilities, were sent by the UE to the SGSN via the UE Network Capability IE, in Attach Request and RAU Request. It is possible that an SGSN does not forward the UE EPS security capabilities to the MME. When the MME does not receive UE EPS security capabilities from the SGSN, the MME shall assume that the following default set of EPS security algorithms is supported by the UE (and shall set the UE EPS security capabilities in the mapped EPS NAS security context according to this default set) a) EEA0, 128-EEA1 and 128-EEA2 for NAS signalling ciphering, RRC signalling ciphering and UP ciphering b) 128-EIA1 and 128-EIA2 for NAS signalling integrity protection and RRC signalling integrity protection NOTE 1: When an EPS algorithm is specified which is not part of the default set, the MME cannot assume that a UE handing over from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN will support that algorithm in the case that the SGSN does not support transfer of the UE's EPS security capabilities to the MME. In this case the MME will select one of the algorithms from the default set instead at handover, and can then switch to the algorithm that is not part of the default set after the MME has received the UE EPS security capabilities from the UE in the Tracking Area Update request.If the operator requires that an algorithm that is not part of the default set has to be taken into use immediately after handover from GERAN/UTRAN to E UTRAN, then the operator has to upgrade the SGSNs to support transfer of the UE EPS security capabilities to the MME NOTE 1a: If the UE has an unauthenticated IMS Emergency Service without integrity protection ongoing before the IRAT handover to LTE, the SGSN must be Rel-9 + and thus be able to forward the UE EPS security capabilities including EIA0 to the MME. In this case the MME would select EIA0 algorithm 2. The MME shall create a NONCEMME to be used in the K'ASME derivation (see clause A.10 for requirements on the randomness of NONCEMME).. MME shall derive K'ASME from CK and IK with the help of a one-way key derivation function as defined in clause A.10 and associate it with a Key Set Identifier KSISGSN. The value field of the KSISGSN shall be derived by assigning the KSI corresponding to the set of keys most recently generated (either by a successful UMTS AKA run in UTRAN (which may or may not yet have been taken into use by the UE and the SGSN) or a UMTS security context mapped from an EPS security context during a previous visit in UTRAN). MME shall derive KeNB from K'ASME using the key derivation function defined in clause A.3. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context shall be set to start value (i.e. 0) in the MME 3. MME shall select the NAS security algorithms (including ciphering and integrity protection) which have the highest priority from its configured list and are also present in the UE EPS security capabilities, MME shall derive the NAS keys from K'ASME using the algorithm types and algorithm IDs as input to the NAS key derivation functions(see Annex A.7), MME shall include KSISGSN, NONCEMME , the selected NAS security algorithms in the NAS Security Transparent Container IE of S1 HO Request message to the target eNB. MME further shall include KeNB and the UE EPS security capabilities, either the capabilities received from the SGSN or, in the absence of these, the default set of EPS security algorithms, in the S1 HO Request message to the target eNB 4. The target eNB shall select the AS algorithms (including ciphering for both RRC and UP, and integrity protection for RRC) which have the highest priority from its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security capabilities. The target eNB shall create a transparent container (RRCConnectionReconfiguration) including the selected RRC, UP algorithms and the NAS Security Transparent Container IE, and send it in the S1 HO Request Ack message towards the MME. The eNB shall derive the RRC and UP from KeNB using the key derivation function defined in clause A.7 NOTE 2: This transparent container is not protected by the target eNB 5. MME shall include the transparent container received from the target eNB in the FW Relocation Response message sent to SGSN 6. SGSN shall include the transparent container in the relocation command sent to the RNC 7. The RNC shall include the transparent container in the UTRAN HO command sent to the UE NOTE 3: The UTRAN HO command is integrity protected and optionally ciphered as specified by TS 33.102 [4] 8. The UE shall derive K'ASME, associate it with KSISGSN and derive KeNB in the same way the MME did in step 2 The UE shall also derive the NAS key as the MME did in step 3 and the RRC and UP keys as the eNB did in step 4. The UE shall send a RRCConnectionReconfiguration Complete messages to the eNB. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context shall be set to start value (i.e. 0) in 9. The mapped EPS security context shall become the current (cf. clause 3.1) EPS security context at AS and NAS level and overwrite any existing current mapped EPS security context. If the current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non current EPS security context. The HO Complete messages and all following AS messages in E-UTRAN shall be ciphered and integrity protected according to the policy of the target PLMN If the handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped EPS security context can not be used in the future. The MME shall delete the new mapped B) Subsequent NAS signalling In order to prevent that successful bidding down on the UE security capabilities in a previous RAT have an effect on the selection of EPS security algorithm for NAS and AS, the UE security capabilities shall be included in the TAU request afterIRAT-HO and be verified by the MME NOTE 4: Any TAU request following the handover will be integrity protected. Details are described in clause 9.2.2.1 In any case UE security capability information received from the UE overwrites any capabilities received with the context transfer as specified in TS 23.401 [2] It can happen that the MME receives different UE EPS security capabilities in the TAU Request from the already stored UE EPS security capabilities in MME (received from the source SGSN or the default UE EPS security capabilities when MME uses the default set of EPS security algorithms for the UE according to A) step 1 above). If it happens, the MME shall perform - In case the TAU Request contains a higher priority NAS algorithm (according to the priority list stored in the MME), the MME run a NAS security mode command procedure to change the NAS algorithms according - MME shall send an S1 CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to inform the eNB about the correct UE EPS security capabilities The eNB shall trigger a change of AS algorithms if the received UE EPS security capabilities from the S1 CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message would contain higher priority AS algorithm (according to the priority list stored in the eNB) 1 If the MME has native security context for the UE and does not receive a TAU request within a certain period after the HO it shall assume that UE and MME share a native security context NOTE 5: A TAU procedure following handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN is mandatory if the Tracking Area has changed, but optional otherwise 2 When the UE sends a TAU request it shall protect the request using the mapped EPS security context identified by KSISGSN. The UE shall also include KSIASME in the TAU request if and only if it has native EPS security context. The KSIASME shall be accompanied by a GUTI. When the MME receives a TAU request with a KSIASME and GUTI corresponding to the non-current native EPS security context stored on that MME it knows that UE and MME share a non-current native EPS security context 4 When the MME receives a TAU request without a KSIASME it shall delete any non-current native EPS security context for any GUTI it may have for the user who sent the TAU request 5 If the MME shares the non-current native EPS security context indexed by the KSIASME and GUTI from the TAU Request with the UE, the MME may run a NAS security mode command procedure with the UE to activate the non-current native EPS NAS security context according to clause 7.2.9.4. The MME may in addition change the KeNB on the fly according to clause 7.2.9.2. In case the GUTI received in the TAU Request message pointed to a different MME, the allocation of a new GUTI, replacing the received GUTI, and the association of this new GUTI with KSIASME is NOTE 6: The TAU Request is integrity protected with the mapped EPS security context even if the UE and the MME share a non-current native EPSsecurity context since the UE cannot know for sure if the MME still has the non-current native EPS security context at the time of sending the TAU Request 7 When the MME knows, after having completed the TAU procedure in the preceding steps, that it shares a non-current native EPS security context with the UE, the MME may (depending on configured policy and if the MME did not do it already in step 5) activate this non-current native EPS security context. This activation may occur in three ways a When the UE has cryptographically protected radio bearers established: the MME shall initiate a key change on the fly procedure according to clause 7.2.9 for the entire EPS key hierarchy b After the next transition to ECM-IDLE state following the handover from UTRAN: Upon receiving the first message from the UE after the UE has gone to ECM-IDLE state the MME shall use the procedures defined in clauses 7.2.4.4 and 7.2.4.5 to activate the non-current native EPS security context if such exists c At the next transition to EMM-DEREGISTERED (see clause 7.2.5.1) 8 If a non-current native EPS security context has been established then the UE and the MME shall delete the mapped EPS security context and set the non-current native EPS security context to the current EPS 9 If the SN id changed during the IRAT handover, the MME shall delay authenticating the UE until after the network has concluded that the UE has received the TAU Accept message which contains the current SN id Doing this ensures that the UE and the MME use the same SN id in the NOTE 7: The run of a NAS SMC procedure ensures that the uplink NAS COUNT has increased since the last time a KeNB was derived from the NOTE 8: For the handling of native and mapped EPS NAS security contexts after a state transition to EMM-DEREGISTERED cf. clause 7.2.5.1 .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shall also include the KSI equal to the value of the eKSI associated with the current EPS security context If the UE does not have a current EPS NAS security context, the UE shall set the truncated NAS-token to all zero and the KSI to '111' to indicate the UE has no keys available The SGSN shall forward the P-TMSI signature including the truncated NAS token to the old MME. The MME may check a non-zero NAS-token as described in clause 9.1.1. If successful, the MME responds with an Identification Response to the SGSN.

Such a SGSN is, according to TS 33.102 required to ensure that the UE is authenticated using UMTS AKA, if the UE supports UMTS AKA. Furthermore, the UE must have a USIM to be able to access EPS, except for unauthenticated emergency calls if allowed by regulations. Hence, UMTS AKA is used when the UE is authenticated to the SGSN supporting interworking between E-UTRAN and GERAN even when attached to GERAN, and UMTS security contexts are available.

On the core network side a SEG may be used to terminate the IPsec tunnel NOTE 1: In case control plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically protected), there is no need to use protection according to TS 33.210 [5] and TS 33.310 [6] Transport mode IPsec is optional for implementation on the X2-C and S1-MME NOTE 2: Transport mode can be used for reducing the protocol overhead If the sender of IPsec traffic uses DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) to distinguish different QoS classes, either by copying DSCP from the inner IP header or directly setting the encapsulating IP header's DSCP, the resulting traffic may be reordered to the point where the receiving node's anti-replay check discards the packet. If different DSCPs are used on the encapsulating IP header, then to avoid packet discard under one IKE SA and with the same set of traffic selectors, distinct Child-SAs should be established for each of the traffic classes (using the DSCPs as classifiers) as is specified in RFC 4301 [34] Other 3GPP specifications may specify other IKEv2 and certificate profiles and IPsec implementation details for specific types of eNBs. The provisions in such other 3GPP specifications shall take precedence over the provisions in the present clause for those specific eNB types only if explicitly listed here. In particular, the provisions for HeNBs specified in TS33.320 [27] shall take precedence over the provisions in this clause 12 Backhaul link user plane protection The protection of user plane data between the eNB and the UE by user specific security associations is covered by clause 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 In order to protect the S1 and X2 user plane as required by clause 5.3.4 it is required to implement IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as profiled by TS 33.210 [5], with confidentiality, integrity and replay protection On the X2-U and S1-U, transport mode IPsec is optional for implementation NOTE 1: Transport mode can be used for reducing the protocol overhead Tunnel mode IPsec is mandatory to implement on the eNB for X2-U and S1-U On the core network side a SEG may be used to terminate the IPsec tunnel If the sender of IPsec traffic uses DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) to distinguish different QoS classes, either by copying DSCP from the inner IP header or directly setting the encapsulating IP header's DSCP, the resulting traffic may be reordered to the point where the receiving node's anti-replay check discards the packet.

The certificates shall be implemented according to the profile described by TS 33.310 [6]. IKEv2 shall be implemented conforming to the IKEv2 profile described in TS 33.310 [6]. Other 3GPP specifications may specify other IKEv2 and certificate profiles and IPsec implementation details for specific types of eNBs. The provisions in such other 3GPP specifications shall take precedence over the provisions in the present clause for those specific eNB types only if explicitly listed here In particular, the provisions for HeNBs specified in TS33.320 [27] shall take precedence over the provisions in this clause NOTE 2: In case S1 and X2 user plane interfaces are trusted (e.g physically protected), the use of IPsec/IKEv2 based protection is 13 Management plane protection over the S1 interface For the management plane protection of relay nodes the provisions in clause D.2.5 apply instead of the provisions given in this clause For management plane protection the requirements in clause 5.3.2 apply In order to achieve such protection, IPsec ESP according to RFC 4303 [7] as profiled by TS 33.210 [5] shall be implemented for all O&M related traffic i.e. the management plane, with confidentiality, integrity and replay Tunnel mode IPsec shall be implemented on the eNB for supporting the management plane. On the core network side a SEG may be used to terminate the IPsec tunnel. If no SEG is used, the IPsec tunnel may be terminated in If the sender of IPsec traffic uses DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) to distinguish different QoS classes, either by copying DSCP from the inner IP header or directly setting the encapsulating IP header's DSCP, the resulting traffic may be reordered to the point where the receiving node's anti-replay check discards the packet.

The certificates shall be implemented according to the profile described by TS 33.310 [6]. IKEv2 shall be implemented conforming to the IKEv2 profile described in TS 33.310 [6] Other 3GPP specifications may specify other IKEv2 and certificate profiles and IPsec implementation details for specific types of eNBs Other 3GPP specifications may specify other security mechanisms and certificate profiles for specific types of eNBs for the case when the management traffic is not carried over the same backhaul link as S1 traffic. If other security mechanisms are specified, they shall provide mutual authentication based on certificates, as well as confidentiality integrity and replay protection. These functions shall have at least equal strength as that provided by the use of IKEv2/IPsec The provisions in such other 3GPP specifications shall take precedence over the provisions in the present clause for those specific eNB types only if explicitly listed here. In particular, the provisions for HeNBs specified in TS33.320 [27] shall take precedence over the provisions in this clause NOTE 1: X2 does not carry management plane traffic NOTE 2: In case the S1 management plane interfaces are trusted (e.g physically protected), the use of protection based on IPsec/IKEv2 or equivalent mechanisms is not needed 14 SRVCC between E-UTRAN and Circuit Switched UTRAN/GERAN 14.1 From E-UTRAN to Circuit Switched UTRAN/GERAN Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) is specified in TS 23.216 [22] The MME shall select the current NAS downlink COUNT value to use in the handover and then increase the stored NAS downlink COUNT value by 1 NOTE 0: Increasing the NAS downlink COUNT by 1 is to ensure that a fresh NAS downlink COUNT is used for any future purposes The MME and the UE shall derive a confidentiality key CKSRVCC, and an integrity key IKSRVCC from KASME of the current EPS security context and the selected NAS downlink COUNT with the help of a one-way key derivation function KDF as specified in clause A.12 The KDF returns a 256-bit output, where the 128 most significant bits are identified with CKSRVCC and the 128 least significant bits are identified The MME shall also provide the 4 LSB of the selected NAS downlink COUNT value to the source eNB, which then includes the bits to the HO Command to the UE. The UE shall use the received 4 LSB and its stored NAS downlink COUNT to estimate the NAS downlink COUNT selected by the MME NOTE 1: It is left to the implementation how to estimate the NAS The UE shall ensure that the estimated NAS downlink COUNT has not been used to calculate a CK' and IK' in a previous successful or unsuccessful PS or SRVCC handover. If the estimated NAS downlink COUNT is greater than all the estimated NAS downlink COUNTs either used by the UE for key derivation in a handover or received in a NAS message that passed its integrity check, the UE shall update its stored NAS downlink COUNT as though it has successfully integrity checked a NAS message with that estimated NAS downlink COUNT. In particular, the stored NAS downlink COUNT shall never be decreased UE and MME shall assign the value of eKSI to KSI. MME shall transfer CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC with KSI and the UE security capability to the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC. The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall replace all the stored UTRAN CS key parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any, with CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC KSI received from the MME when the SRVCC handover is successful. The UE shall replace all the stored UTRAN CS key parameters CK, IK, KSI, if any with CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC, KSI in both ME and USIM. STARTCS shall comply with the rules in TS 25.331 [24] The ME shall use CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC to derive the GSM CS Kc using the c3 function specified in TS 33.102 [4]. The ME shall assign the eKSI value (associated with CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC) to the GSM CS CKSN (associated with the GSM CS Kc). The ME shall update the USIM and ME with the GSM CS Kc and NOTE 2: The new derived security context (including CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC and KSI) replacing the stored values in the USIM is for allowing to reuse the derived security context without invoking the authentication procedure in subsequent connection set-ups, and also for avoiding that one KSI value indicates to two different key sets and consequently leads to security context desynchronization NOTE 3: An operator concerned about the security of keys received from an E-UTRAN of another operator may want to enforce a policy in the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC to run a UMTS AKA as soon as possible after the handover. One example of ensuring this is the deletion of the mapped UMTS security context in the enhanced MSC server after the UE has left active state NOTE 4: Due to replacing all the UTRAN CS key parameters CK, IK, KSI with CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC and KSI on USIM and in ME, a new GSM CS Kc needs to be derived from the new UTRAN CS key parameters CK and IK (i.e. CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC), which is part of the new UMTS security context as well, as any old GSM CS Kc stored on USIM and in ME belongs to an old UMTS security context and can no longer be taken If the SRVCC is from E-UTRAN to GERAN, the above description in this clauseapplies as well for the MME, the enhanced MSC server and the UE. The enhanced MSC server shall in addition derive GSM CS cipher key Kc from CKSRVCC and IKSRVCC with the help of the key conversion function c3 as specified in TS 33.102 [4], and assign the value of eKSI to GSM CS CKSN associated with the GSM CS Kc, and the target MSC server and UE shall compute the 128-bit GSM CS cipher key Kc128 as specified in TS 33.102 [4] when the new encryption algorithm selected by the target BSS requires Kc128. The UE and the enhanced MSC Server shall assign the value of eKSI to GSM CS CKSN associated with the GSM CS Kc128 Non-voice bearers may be handed over during the SRVCC handover operation For this case, k ey derivation for non-voice bearers is specified in clause .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall delete the new mapped CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC and KSISRVCC and the stored parameters CKCS and IKCS which has the same KSI as the new mapped CKSRVCC, IKSRVCC (if such exist) 14.2 Emergency call in SRVCC from E-UTRAN to circuit switched UTRAN/GERAN If the SRVCC is for an emergency call and the session in EUTRAN complies with clause 15.2.1, the security procedure in clause 14.1 shall be applied If the SRVCC is for an emergency call and the session in EUTRAN complies with clause 15.2.2, the security procedure in clause 14.1 shall not be applied, i.e., no key derivation is needed 14.3 SRVCC from circuit switched UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN The procedure for SRVCC handover from UTRAN/GERAN CS to E-UTRAN, as far as relevant for security, proceeds as described below The activation of NAS and AS security in E-UTRAN, and selection of the key set from the source system for the handover shall be according to following i) The source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall select the key set most recently generated. This key set may have been generated by either a successful UMTS AKA run in UTRAN or from a UMTS security context mapped from an EPS security context during a previous visit to UTRAN. The UE and source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC may or may not have taken the key set into use. The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall transfer this key set to the MME in the CS to PS HO request ii) Activation of AS security in the UE (for details cf. TS 36.331 The CS to PS HO command received at the UE shall activate AS security The CS to PS HO Confirmation received at the eNB shall activate AS security in the eNB iii) Activation of NAS security (for details cf. TS 24.301 [9]) The CS to PS HO request received at the UE shall activate NAS security The Handover Notify received at the MME shall activate NAS security in the MME. In case the MME does not have the UE security capabilities stored from a previous visit, then the MME shall only accept TAU requests from this UE, and shall not send any messages to this UE until the MME has successfully checked the UE security capabilities received in a TAU request from this UE iv) Both AS and NAS ciphering and integrity protection algorithms shall be selected according to the policy of the target PLMN The above four principles consequentially always activate ciphering (potentially NULL ciphering) in E-UTRAN even if it was not active in the [pic]Figure 14.3.1-1: SRVCC handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN. Key derivations in the figure are only shown for UMTS subscribers Handover signalling in case of successful handover Before attempting a handover for a UE, the source RNC/BSC may check if the UE is authenticated using UMTS AKA as described in clause 9.2.2.1 of the present document, and may avoid doing a SRVCC handover to E-UTRAN in case the UE is not authenticated using UMTS AKA and does not have an ongoing NOTE 1: The numbering in the followingrefers to the signalling numbering 1. The source BSC/RNC sends HO required to the source MSC server enhanced 2. For UMTS and GSM subscribers, the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall generate a NONCEMSC For UMTS subscribers, the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall derive CK'PS and IK'PS from the NONCEMSC and the latest CKCSand IKCS using the key derivation function as specified in annex B.6 of TS 33.102 [2]. The source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall further set the KSI'PS equal to the KSICS associated with the latest key set as specified for SRVCC from UTRAN/GERAN to HSPA in TS 33.102 [2] For GSM subscribers, the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall derive GPRS Kc' from the NONCEMSC and the latest GSM Kc using the key derivation function as specified in annex B.7 of TS 33.102 [2] . The source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall further set the CKSN'PS equal to the CKSNCS associated with the latest key set as specified for SRVCC from UTRAN/GERAN to HSPA in TS 33.102 [2] For UMTS subscribers, the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall transfer the CK'PS/IK'PS and the KSI'PS, to the target MME in the CS to PS For GSM subscribers, the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall transfer the GPRS Kc' and the CKSN'PS, to the target MME in the CS to PS NOTE 2: The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC does not include any authentication vectors in the CS to PS HO request, since this could result in that authentication vectors intended for use only in the CS domain would end up being used in a PS domain by accident NOTE 3: The MSC server enhanced for SRVCC does not include any UE security capability information in the CS to PS HO request, since the target MME either has this information available, or will retrieve the information from the old SGSN. Further, the MSC may not have access to the complete UE security capabilities If the MME receives a GPRS Kc' from the source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC in the CS to PS HO request, the MME shall reject the request 3 and 4. The MME shall discard any CK, IK, Kc, CKSN and KSI retrieved from the old SGSN in a context request procedure The MME shall create a mapped EPS security context by setting the K'ASME of the mapped EPS security context equal to the concatenation CK'PS || IK'PS, where the CK'PSand IK'PS were received in the CS to PS handover request. The MME shall further associate the K'ASME with a KSISGSN. The value of the KSISGSN shall be the same as the value of the KSI'PS received in the CS to PS handover request NOTE 4: The naming of the KSISGSN hints at that this identifier is somehow related to an SGSN. However, in this case it is related to the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC. Even though KSIMSCcould have been a more appropriate name here, the name KSISGSNis kept to avoid introducing a new name for the same entity The MME shall derive KeNB by applying the KDF as defined in Annex A. 3 using the mapped key K'ASME and 232-1 as the value of the uplink NAS COUNT parameter. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context shall be set to start value (i.e. 0) in the If the MME does not have access to the UE EPS security capabilities the MME shall assume that the default set of EPS security algorithms defined in clause 9.2.2.1 of the present document is supported by the UE (and the MME shall set the UE EPS security capabilities in the mapped EPS security context according to this default set). The same considerations regarding security algorithm selection using the default set as noted in clause 9.2.2.1 of the present document applies here. If the security context information received from the old SGSN contains EPS security capabilities or the MME already have access to EPS security capabilities for the UE, the MME shall populate the mapped EPS security context with these EPS security capabilities instead of falling back to the default set of security algorithms If the MME received any authentication vectors from the old SGSN, the MME shall process these authentication vectors according to clause 6.1.6 of the present document 5. MME shall select the NAS security algorithms (including ciphering and integrity protection) which have the highest priority from its configured list and are also present in the UE EPS security capabilities. MME shall derive the NAS keys from K'ASME using the algorithm types and algorithm IDs as input to the NAS key derivation functions (see Annex A.7). MME generates NONCEMME. MME shall include KSISGSN, NONCEMMEand the selected NAS security algorithms in the NAS Security Transparent Container IE of Allocate resources message to the target eNB. MME shall further include KeNB and the UE EPS security capabilities from the mapped EPS security contextin the Allocate resources message to the target eNB 6. The target eNB shall select the AS algorithms (including ciphering for both RRC and UP, and integrity protection for RRC) which have the highest priority from its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security capabilities. The target eNB creates a target to source transparent container that contains a handover command (the target to source transparent container is denoted ""E-UTRAN RRC container"" in Figure 14.3.1-1). The handover command incluesd the selected RRC, UP algorithms and the NAS Security Transparent Container IE, and the eNB sends the target to source transparent container in the Allocate resources Ack message towards the MME. The eNB shall derive the keys for RRC and UP protection from the received KeNB using the key derivation function defined in clause A.7 NOTE 5: The handover command in the target to source transparent container is not security protected by the target eNB 7. MME shall include the target to source transparent container received from the target eNB in the CS to PS HO Response message sent to source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC 8. Source MSC server enhanced for SRVCC shall include the NONCEMSC and the target to source transparent container in the relocation command sent to the BSC/RNC in the CS to PS HO command 9. The RNC/BSC shall include the NONCEMSC and the transparent container in the CS to PS HO command sent to the UE NOTE 6: The CS to PS HO command is integrity protected and optionally ciphered in UTRAN. It is optionally ciphered in GERAN as specified 10. For UMTS subscribers the ME shall silently discard the NONCEMME received in received in the NAS Security Transparent Container. The ME shall further derive K'ASME, associate it with KSISGSN recived in the NAS Security Transparent Container IE and derive NAS keys and KeNB following the same key derivations as the MSC and MME performed in steps 2, 3 and 4. The ME shall also derive the RRC and UP keys as the eNB did in (see description for message 6 above). The UE sends a CS to PS HO Confirmation message to the target eNB. The ME shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context to start value (i.e. 0) NOTE 7: Since the MME denies access to E-UTRAN for GSM subscribers, the UE never has to perform any key derivations for GSM subscribers The mapped EPS security context established as above shall become the current (cf. clause 3.1) EPS security context at AS and NAS level. The MME and ME shalloverwrite any existing current mapped EPS security context with the newly created one. If the current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context. The MME and ME shall in this case also overwrite any existing non-current EPS security context with this current native EPS security context. The CS to PS HO Confirmation messages and all following AS messages in E-UTRAN shall be ciphered and integrity protected according to the policy of the target PLMN If the SRVCC handover is not completed successfully, the new mapped EPS security context cannot be used in the future. The MME and the ME shall in this case delete the new mapped EPS security context The text regarding subsequent NAS signalling in bullet B) in clause 9.2.2.1 of the present specification applies also after an SRVCC handover from In SRVCC handover from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN, the STARTPS and STARTCS values used in UTRAN shall be kept in the volatile memory of the ME, cf also clause 6.8.11 of TS 33.102 [4] 15 Security Aspects of IMS Emergency Session Handling Support for IMS Emergency Sessions is defined in the TS23.401 [2]. Limited service state of a UE is defined in TS 23.122 [26]. IMS Emergency Sessions can be made by normally attached UEs or UEs attached for EPS emergency bearer services. IMS Emergency Services can be authenticated or unauthenticated as defined in clauses below. It depends on the serving network policy if unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions are allowed. Any behaviour not explicitly specified as being special to IMS Emergency Sessions is handled in accordance to normal procedures The E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure, with Attach Type ""Emergency"", is used by UEs that need to receive EPS emergency bearer services but cannot receive normal services from the network For an Initial Attach with Attach Type ""Emergency"" the UE includes the IMSI in the Attach request if the UE does not have a valid GUTI. The UE shall include the IMEI when the UE has no IMSI, no valid GUTI according to [2] When involved in an Attach for EPS emergency bearer services the MME applies the parameters from MME Emergency Configuration Data for the EPS emergency bearer establishment. Any potentially stored IMSI related subscription data is ignored by the MME according to [2] When involved in an Attach for EPS emergency bearer services the MME does not send any Notify Request to an HSS A UE attached for EPS emergency bearer services using NULL algorithms shall keep the NULL algorithms and corresponding NAS COUNTs when in EMM-IDLE mode so that it is reachable for subsequent IMS Emergency Sessions without the need to attach for EPS emergency bearer services again. The NULL algorithms shall be de-selected and corresponding NAS COUNTs shall be removed when the UE goes to EMM-DEREGISTERED state or when another EPS NAS security context The MME or UE shall always release any established non-emergency bearers when the authentication fails in the UE or in the MME 15.2 Security procedures and their applicability 15.2.1 Authenticated IMS Emergency Sessions UEs that are not in limited service state, shall initiate normal initial attach when not already attached to receive EPS emergency bearer services The security mode control procedure shall be applied as part of EPS emergency bearer establishment as defined in TS23.401 [2]. Thus, integrity protection (and optionally ciphering) shall be applied as for normal EPS bearers. If authentication fails for any reason, the handling of the EPS emergency bearer services shall be handled as specified in clauses 15.2.1 and 15.2.2 below. Once the IMS Emergency Session is in progress with NAS and AS integrity protection (and optionally ciphering) applied, failure of integrity checking or ciphering (for both NAS and AS) is an unusual circumstance and shall be treated as in the case of a normal EPS bearer 15.2.1.2 UE and MME share a current security context If the UE already has a current EPS security context and attempts to set up an IMS Emergency Session, the UE shall use this EPS security context to protect NAS, RRC and UP traffic. If the MME successfully validates a request for EPS emergency bearer services using the current EPS security context, the MME should accept this request. A request for EPS emergency bearer services is defined to be, for the purposes of this document, an Attach request message for EPS emergency bearer services or a PDN Connectivity request message for EPS emergency bearer services NOTE 1: It is defined in TS 23.401 [2] and TS 24.301 [9] how Attach requests and/or PDN Connectivity requests are used to set up EPS If the authentication fails during a normal Attach procedure, or a Service request procedure, while the UE is in normal service mode, and the UE intends to set up an IMS Emergency Session, the UE shall retry by sending an Attach request for EPS emergency bearer services If the MME attempts to authenticate the UE after receiving a request for EPS emergency bearer services which was integrity protected by the current EPS NAS security context and the authentication failed and if the serving network policy does not allow unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, the UE and MME shall proceed as for set up of normal EPS bearers as described If the MME attempts to authenticate the UE after receiving a request for EPS emergency bearer services which was integrity protected by the current EPS NAS security context and the authentication failed and the serving network policy allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, then the UE and the MME behaviours are described in the paragraph below If the authentication failure is detected in the UE or in the MME during an attach procedure for EPS emergency bearer services or a PDN connectivity request procedure for EPS emergency bearer services, and the related signalling messages were correctly integrity-protected by the current EPS security context, the set up of the EPS emergency bearers shall then proceed in one of two ways a) The set-up proceeds according to clause15.2.2. In this case, there is no need for the UE to re-attach, and the MME requests the use of the NULL ciphering and integrity algorithms in the same way as described in clause 15.2.2.2 for the case that UE and MME share no EPS security NOTE 2: If the authentication failure is detected in the MME then the UE is not aware of the failure in the MME, but still needs to be prepared, according to the conditions specified in TS 24.301, to accept a NAS SMC from the MME requesting the use of the NULL ciphering and integrity algorithms b) Or else, if the serving network policy allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions and MME continues using the current security context, the use of the EPS emergency bearers may proceed as described below for the case of an AKA run while a PDN connection for emergency NOTE 3: Regardless of if the authentication failed in the UE or in the MME, the MME can assume that the UE will accept that NULL integrity and ciphering algorithms are selected in the security mode control If AKA is run while a PDN connection for emergency bearer services exists the MME and UE shall behave as follows - Upon successful authentication verification in the UE, the UE shall send RES to the MME NOTE 4: If the authentication failure is detected in the MME, the UE is not aware of the failure in the MME if the MME continues to use the current security context with the UE. The UE consider itself to be in normal service, if it was normal attached before the PDN connectivity request procedure for EPS emergency bearer services was initiated, until the MME releases the non-emergency bearers established with the UE - Alternatively, upon authentication verification failure in the UE, the UE shall send an Authentication Failure message to the MME. The UE shall continue using the current EPS security context. If the UE receives a NAS security mode command selecting NULL integrity and ciphering algorithms, the UE shall accept this as long as the IMS - If the serving network policy requires IMS Emergency Sessions to be authenticated, the MME shall, after the unsuccessful comparison of RES to XRES, i.e. AKA failure, proceed as if the request for EPS emergency bearers was a request for normal EPS bearer services. The MME should not send an Authentication Reject message if authentication failed in the MME and the serving network policy allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions. If the MME does not send an Authentication Reject message it shall continue using the current security context with the - After receiving both, the EC Indication and the Authentication Failure message, the MME shall continue using the current security context with the UE for establishing an EPS emergency bearer NOTE : In the case that NAS COUNT values are about to wrap around, and AKA fails, or if the MME is unable to fetch new authentication vectors, the handling of the EPS emergency beares are as described by TS 24.301 [9] 15.2.2 Unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions Authentication may fail for a UE attached for EPS emergency bearer services just as for a UE attached for normal EPS bearer services when the UE tries to establish an IMS Emergency Session As defined in TS23.401 [2] and as a serving network option, IMS Emergency Sessions may be established in limited service state without the network having to authenticate the UE or apply ciphering or integrity protection for either AS or NAS The following are the only identified cases where the ""security procedure not applied"" option may be used a) Authentication is impossible because the USIM is absent b) Authentication is impossible because the serving network cannot obtain authentication vectors due to a network failure c) Authentication is impossible because the USIM is in limited service mode in the serving network (e.g. there is no roaming agreement or the IMSI is barred, etc.) d) Authentication is possible but the serving network cannot successfully If the ME receives a NAS SMC selecting EIA0 (NULL integrity) for integrity protection, and EEA0 (NULL ciphering) for encryption protection, then - the ME shall mark any stored native EPS NAS security context on the USIM /non-volatile ME memory as invalid; and - the ME shall not update the USIM/non-volatile ME memory with the current EPS NAS security context These two rules override all other rules regarding updating the EPS NAS security context on the USIM/non-volatile ME memory, in this If EIA0 is used, and the NAS COUNT values wrap around, and a new KASME has not been established before the NAS COUNT wrap around, the NAS connection NOTE: For unauthenticated emergency calls, EIA0, i.e., null integrity algorithm, is used for integrity protection. Additionally, as the NAS COUNT values are allowed to wrap around, the initialization of the NAS COUNT values are not crucial. Uplink and downlink NAS COUNT are incremented for NAS message that use EIA0, as for any other NAS Since a UE with a 2G SIM cannot be in authenticated via EPS AKA, it shall be considered by the MME to be unauthenticated in E-UTRAN. A UE with a 2G SIM shall at an IRAT handover to E-UTRAN when an IMS Emergency Service is active, be considered by the MME to be unauthenticated. In such a scenario EIA0 shall be used in E-UTRAN after handover if the target network policy allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions A handover from E-UTRAN to another RAT, of an unauthenticated IMS Emergency Session, shall result in an unauthenticated IMS Emergency Session or a circuit switched emergency call (depending on if it is a PS handover or SRVCC) in the other RAT 15.2.2.2 UE and MME share no security context If the MME attempts to authenticate the UE after receiving the EPS emergency bearer setup request and the authentication failed and if the serving network policy does not allow unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, the UE and MME shall proceed as for normal EPS bearer setup requests as described in clause6.1.1 If the UE is not yet authenticated and while the UE is trying to setup an IMS Emergency Session, the authentication failed in the UE, the UE shall wait for a NAS SMC command to set up an unauthenticated emergency bearer If the serving network policy supports unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, only then the MME shall support unauthenticated EPS emergency bearer setup. In this case, the behaviours of the UE and the MME are as The confluence of EPS emergency bearer setup and authentication failure means that the UE is considered by the MME and UE itself to be in LSM even though the UE could have been in normal service mode before the EPS After sending EC Indication to the serving network the UE shall know of its own intent to establish an IMS Emergency Session - The UE will proceed as specified for the non-emergency case in clauses 6 and 7 of this specification except that the UE shall accept a NAS SMC selecting EEA0 and EIA0 algorithms from the MME NOTE: In case of authentication success the MME will send a NAS SMC selecting algorithms as defined in clause 7 of this specification i.e. with a non-NULL integrity algorithm, and the UE will accept After receiving EC Indication from the UE, the MME knows of that UE's intent to establish an IMS Emergency Session - If the MME cannot identify the subscriber, or cannot obtain authentication vectors, the MME shall send NAS SMC with NULL algorithms to the UE regardless of the supported algorithms announced previously NOTE: The case where the MME cannot obtain authentication vectors includes also all the cases where IMSI is required by the MME (see TS 23.401[2], clause 4.3.12.1) - After the unsuccessful comparison of RES to XRES, i.e. AKA failure the MME shall send NAS SMC with NULL algorithms to the UE regardless of the supported algorithms announced previously by the UE - After the receiving of both, the EC Indication and the Authentication Failure messages, the MME shall send NAS SMC with NULL algorithms to the UE regardless of the supported algorithms announced previously by If the serving network policy does not allow unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions, the MME shall reject the unauthenticated EPS emergency bearer setup request from the UE 15.2.4 Key generation procedures for unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions An unauthenticated UE does not share a complete EPS NAS security context with the network. Since there has been no successful EPS AKA run, the UE and the MME does not share a KASME. When the UE and the MME does not share a KASME the only possibility for an MME that allows unauthenticated IMS Emergency Sessions is to run with the NULL integrity algorithm EIA0 and the NULL ciphering algorithm EEA0. These algorithms are not affected by the choice of key. Therefore the UE and the MME independently generate a KASME in an implementation defined way and populate the EPS NAS security context with this KASME to be used when activating an EPS NAS security context for which no successful EPS AKA run has been made. After this EPS NAS security context is activated all key derivations proceed as if they were based on a KASME generated from an EPS AKA run Even if no confidentiality or integrity protection is provided by EIA0 and EEA0, the UE and network treat the EPS security context with the independently generated KASME as if it contained a normally generated KASME and hence share an EPS security context (see TS 24.301[9]) When UE attempts to make X2/S1 handover, UE and eNB derive and transfer the keys as normal to re-use the normal handover mechanism. Since the derived keys have no ability to affect the output of the NULL algorithms it is irrelevant that the network and the UE derive different keys. Furthermore clause7.2.4a describes how the algorithm selection is handled for unauthenticated emergency call. This implies that source eNB will forward UE EPS security capability which contains EIA0 and EEA0 only to target eNB So the target eNB can only select EIA0 for integrity protection and EEA0 for confidential protection. If the UE does not receive any selection of new AS security algorithms during a intra-eNB handover, the UE continues to use the same algorithms as before the handover (see TS 36.331 [21]) NOTE: If the target eNB is a Rel-8 eNB, it can't support EIA0 and EEA0 The handover will be rejected because of the failure of algorithm A.1 KDF interface and input parameter construction All key derivations (including input parameter encoding) for EPS shall be performed using the key derivation function (KDF) specified in TS 33.220 [8]. This clause specifies how to construct the input string, S, to the KDF (which is input together with the relevant key). For each of the distinct usages of the KDF, the input parameters S are specified below A.1.2 FC value allocations The FC number space used is controlled by TS 33.220 [8], FC values allocated for this specification are in range of 0x10 0x1F A.2 KASME derivation function When deriving a KASME from CK, IK and SN id when producing authentication vectors, and when the UE computes KASME during AKA, the following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the KDF - FC = 0x10 - P0 = SN id - L0 = length of SN id (i.e. 0x00 0x03) - P1 = SQN (AK - L1 = length of SQN (AK (i.e. 0x00 0x06) The exclusive or of the Sequence Number (SQN) and the Anonymity Key (AK) is sent to the UE as a part of the Authentication Token (AUTN), see TS 33.102 If AK is not used, AK shall be treated in accordance with TS 33.102, i.e The SN id consists of MCC and MNC, and shall be encoded as an octet string according to Figure A.2-1 |8 |7 |6 | | | | | |MNC digit 3 |MCC digit 3 |octet 2 | | | | | |MNC digit 2 |MNC digit 1 |octet 3 | Figure A.2-1 Encoding of SN id as an octet string The coding of the digits of MCC and MNC shall be done according to TS The input key Key shall be equal to the concatenation CK || IK of CK and A.3 KeNB derivation function When deriving a KeNB from KASME and the uplink NAS COUNT in the UE and the MME the following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the KDF - FC = 0x11 - P0 = Uplink NAS COUNT - L0 = length of uplink NAS COUNT (i.e. 0x00 0x04) The input key shall be the 256-bit KASME This function is applied when cryptographically protected E-UTRAN radio bearers are established and when a key change on-the-fly is performed A.4 NH derivation function When deriving a NH from KASME the following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the KDF - FC = 0x12 - P0 = SYNC-input - L0 = length of SYNC-input (i.e. 0x00 0x20) The SYNC-input parameter shall be the newly derived KeNB for the initial NH derivation, and the previous NH for all subsequent derivations.

This would lead to different derived keys if another entity assumed an input parameter length of 3 bytes for the EARFCN-DL The input key shall be the 256-bit NH when the index in the handover increases, otherwise the current 256-bit KeNB A.7 Algorithm key derivation functions When deriving keys for NAS integrity and NAS encryption algorithms from KASME and algorithm types and algorithm IDs, and keys for RRC integrity, UP integrity, and RRC/UP encryption algorithms from KeNB, in the UE, MME and eNB the following parameters shall be used to form the string S - FC = 0x15 - P0 = algorithm type distinguisher - L0 = length of algorithm type distinguisher (i.e. 0x00 0x01) - P1 = algorithm identity - L1 = length of algorithm identity (i.e. 0x00 0x01) The algorithm type distinguisher shall be NAS-enc-alg for NAS encryption algorithms and NAS-int-alg for NAS integrity protection algorithms.

The length of the KEYSTREAM generated shall be equal to the LENGTH input parameter. The generated KEYSTREAM requires no other input parameters but the LENGTH Apart from this, all processing performed in association with ciphering shall be exactly the same as with any of the ciphering algorithms specified The EIA0 algorithm shall be implemented in such way that it shall generate a 32 bit MAC-I/NAS-MAC and XMAC-I/XNAS-MAC of all zeroes (see clause B.2.1). Replay protection shall not be activated when EIA0 is activated All processing performed in association with integrity (except for replay protection) shall be exactly the same as with any of the integrity algorithms specified in this annex except that the receiver does not check NOTE 1: The reason for mentioning the replay protection here is that replay protection is associated with integrity EIA0 shall be used only for emergency calling for unauthenticated UEs in NOTE 2: a UE with a 2G SIM is considered to be in LSM in E-UTRAN NOTE 3: EEA0 and EIA0 provide no security B.1 128-bit ciphering algorithm B.1.1 Inputs and outputs The input parameters to the ciphering algorithm are a 128-bit cipher key named KEY, a 32-bit COUNT, a 5-bit bearer identity BEARER, the 1-bit direction of the transmission i.e. DIRECTION, and the length of the keystream required i.e. LENGTH. The DIRECTION bit shall be 0 for uplink and Figure B.1-1 illustrates the use of the ciphering algorithm EEA to encrypt plaintext by applying a keystream using a bit per bit binary addition of the plaintext and the keystream. The plaintext may be recovered by generating the same keystream using the same input parameters and applying a bit per bit binary addition with the ciphertext Figure B.1-1: Ciphering of data Based on the input parameters the algorithm generates the output keystream block KEYSTREAM which is used to encrypt the input plaintext block PLAINTEXT to produce the output ciphertext block CIPHERTEXT The input parameter LENGTH shall affect only the length of the KEYSTREAM BLOCK, not the actual bits in it 128-EEA1 is based on SNOW 3G and is identical to UEA2 as specified in [14] The used IV is constructed the same way as in clause 3.4 of that TS 128-EEA2 is based on 128-bit AES [15] in CTR mode [16] The sequence of 128-bit counter blocks needed for CTR mode T1, T2, , Ti, shall be constructed as follows The most significant 64 bits of T1 consist of COUNT[0] .. COUNT[31] BEARER[0] .. BEARER[4] DIRECTION 026 (i.e. 26 zero bits). These are written from most significant on the left to least significant on the right, so for example COUNT[0] is the most significant bit of T1 The least significant 64 bits of T1 are all 0 Subsequent counter blocks are then obtained by applying the standard integer incrementing function (according to Appendix B1 in [16]) mod 264 to the least significant 64 bits of the previous counter block 128-EEA3 is based on ZUC and specified in [33] B.2 128-Bit integrity algorithm B.2.1 Inputs and outputs The input parameters to the integrity algorithm are a 128-bit integrity key named KEY, a 32-bit COUNT, a 5-bit bearer identity called BEARER, the 1-bit direction of the transmission i.e. DIRECTION, and the message itself i.e MESSAGE. The DIRECTION bit shall be 0 for uplink and 1 for downlink. The bit length of the MESSAGE is LENGTH Figure B.2-1 illustrates the use of the integrity algorithm EIA to authenticate the integrity of messages Figure B.2-1: Derivation of MAC-I/NAS-MAC (or XMAC-I/XNAS-MAC) Based on these input parameters the sender computes a 32-bit message authentication code (MAC-I/NAS-MAC) using the integrity algorithmEIA. The message authentication code is then appended to the message when sent. For integrity protection algorithms other than EIA0 the receiver computes the expected message authentication code (XMAC-I/XNAS-MAC) on the message received in the same way as the sender computed its message authentication code on the message sent and verifies the data integrity of the message by comparing it to the received message authentication code, i.e. MAC-I/NAS 128-EIA1 is based on SNOW 3G and is implemented in the same way as UIA2 as specified in [14]. The used IV is constructed the same way as in clause 4.4 of that TS, with the only difference being that FRESH [0], FRESH [31] shall be replaced by BEARER[0] BEARER[4] 027 (i.e. 27 zero bits) 128-EIA2 is based on 128-bit AES [15] in CMAC mode [17] The bit length of MESSAGE is BLENGTH The input to CMAC mode is a bit string M of length Mlen (see [17 clause5.5]). M is constructed as follows M0 .. M31 = COUNT[0] .. COUNT[31] M32 .. M36 = BEARER[0] .. BEARER[4] M38 .. M63 = 026 (i.e. 26 zero bits) M64 .. MBLENGTH+63 = MESSAGE[0] .. T is used directly as the 128-EIA2 output MACT[0] .. MACT[31], with MACT[0] being the most significant bit of T No new test data are provided for 128-EEA1, because the test data for UEA2 can be reused directly there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between UEA2 inputs and 128-EEA1 inputs This clauseincludes seven test data sets; all are presented in hex, while the first is also presented in binary Bit ordering should be largely self explanatory," but in particular - The 5-bit BEARER is written in hex in a """"right aligned"""" form", i.e. as a two-hex-digit value in the range 00 to 1F inclusive," with BEARER [0] as the msb of the first digit - Similarly the single DIRECTION bit is written in hex in """"right aligned"""" form", i.e. the DIRECTION bit is the lsb of the hex digit - Where the length of the message, or of a message sub-block, is not a multiple of 32 bits," it is written in hex in a """"left aligned"""" form i.e. the least significant few bits of the last word will be zero NOTE: This clauseprovides both byte aligned and non byte aligned test data sets. For EPS implementation verification", byte alignment test data sets (1, 4 and 7)can be used, as EPS RRC and EPS NAS messages are byte aligned. The non byte aligned test data setsmay be used to verify implementations that support non byte aligned messages This Annex provides the security procedures applied to relay nodes Security requirements and security features applied to relay nodes can be found in the main body of the present specification The overall stage 2 description for relay nodes can be found in TS 23.401 [2] and TS 36.300 [30] The basic idea of the solution for relay node security presented in this Annex is realizing a one-to-one binding of an RN and a USIM called USIM-RN Such a one-to-one binding is realized in this solution either by using symmetric pre-shared keys (psk) or by certificates. In the psk case, the binding needs to be pre-established in the UICC and in the RN prior to deployment; in the certificate case, the binding needs to be pre established only in the UICC prior to deployment. The use of certificates has the advantage that there is a standardized procedure for enrolling the private key corresponding to the certificate in the secure environment of the RN while the use of a psk requires manual operation for establishing the psk. A further advantage is that the name (identity) in the certificate can be given at time of enrolment, and does not have to be pre-established On the other hand, the use of a psk has the advantage that no PKI is required and the procedure after pre-establishment of the psk is simpler When using certificates for this one-to-one binding, a part of the usual certificate handling is replaced by subscription handling, as explained in The certificate-based procedures are mandatory to support The pre-shared-key-based procedures are mandatory to support NOTE 1: The provisioning of pre-shared keys is out of the scope of this When using certificates the UICC inserted in the RN shall contain two USIMs: a USIM-RN which shall perform any communication only via a secure channel, and a USIM-INI communicating with the RN without secure channel and used for initial IP connectivity purposes prior to RN attachment. The UICC shall establish a secure channel only with a particular relay node, as detailed in the procedures described in D.2.2. The UICC verifies this relay node by means of data pre-established in the UICC When using psk only the USIM-RN is required. This USIM-RN shall perform any communication only via a secure channel NOTE 2: USIM-INI and USIM-RN are described in TS 31.102 [3] The start-up of an RN shall proceed in the following steps, which are arranged in three phases. The Preparation Phase and Phase II procedures are the same for the certificate-based and the PSK-based case. Phase I procedures differ between the certificate-based case and the pre-shared key based case. If one of the steps fails in any of the involved entities the procedure shall be aborted by that entity, and the steps that follow the failed step shall not be executed (but the sending of failure messages is The RN platform secure environment shall perform an integrity check of the RN platform. This shall include checking the integrity of the sensitive parts of the boot process and proceeding with the boot process only if the integrity checks of all these parts are successful Phase I: Procedures prior to the RN attach procedure (certificate-based For the certificate-based case, the RN may skip Phase I attachment if the RN has an operator certificate available and a valid CRL list (if needed) NOTE0: There may be reasons to perform Phase I attachment even if operator certificate and valid CRL are available Ec2. The RN shall attach as a UE using USIM-INI if step Ec3 needs to be Ec3. The RN shall obtain an operator certificate through the enrolment procedure defined in TS 33.310 [6] unless an operator certificate is already available. Details can be found in clause D.2.4. The RN may optionally establish a secure connection to an OAM server. Details can be found in clause D.2.5. The RN shall retrieve a CRL from a suitable server if no valid CRL is available locally in the RN and the RN supports and is configured to perform CRL checks. For revocation checking of UICC certificates see clause D.2.6. For the handling of CRLs for UICC certificates see also clause D.3.3.4 Ec4. After completing step Ec3," the RN shall detach from the network and de-activate the USIM-INI if it attached in step Ec2. If the UICC needs to be configured over the air (OTA) this may also be done in this step Ec5. The RN platform secure environment and the UICC shall establish a Secure Channel between RN and USIM-RN according to ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7 """"Secured APDU"""" with TLS handshake. This TLS handshake shall be initiated by the RN and use certificates on both sides. The RN shall either use a pre-established certificate or the certificate enrolled in step Ec3. The UICC shall verify that this certificate belongs to the relay node the USIM-RN is bound to. The UICC shall be pre-provisioned with an operator root certificate to verify the RN certificate. The UICC certificate shall be pre-installed in the UICC by the operator The RN shall be provisioned with a root certificate to verify the UICC Ec6. A certificate validation client on the UICC shall verify the signatures in the RN certificate chain up to the root certificate. The check of revocation status and expiry time shall be omitted. A certificate validation client on the RN shall check the verification of the signatures in the UICC certificate chain up to the root certificate as well as the expiry time. The revocation status of the UICC certificate should be checked by means of CRLs. Furthermore", the requirements in clause D.2.3 on 'USIM Binding Aspects' shall apply NOTE 1: The root certificate, and potentially other data required, that need to be stored in the UICC could be provisioned in the UICC during its personalization. The operator provides to smart card manufacturer a list of data (e.g. IMSI, key K, etc) to be provisioned in the UICC during its personalization phase, before issuance of the UICC. The root certificate, and potentially other data, could be provided by the operator as part of the data to be personalized in the UICC by the smart card manufacturer. In the field, the root certificate, and potentially other data, could also be updated by OTA means, if needed The private key corresponding to the RN certificate and the root certificate used to verify the UICC certificate shall be stored in the secure environment of the RN platform validated in the Preparation Phase and the TLS connection as well as the secure channel with the UICC shall terminate there. From the completion of this step onwards," all communication between the USIM-RN and the RN shall be protected by the The USIM-RN shall not engage in any communication with any entity prior to the the completion of establishment of the Secure Channel according to steps Ec5 and Ec6 other than messages for establishing the Secure Channel according to ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7 """"Secured APDU"""" NOTE 2: Certificate use restriction may be made possible e.g. through a suitable name structure", or a particular intermediate CA in the verification path, or policy information terms," e.g. by a suitable object identifier (OID) in the certificate policies extension NOTE 3: ETSI TS 102 484 [29] states in clause 6.2.2: """"The UICC may present a self-signed certificate. The terminal or terminal application should temporarily accept such a certificate during the TLS handshake protocol"," if it is able to establish by other means (e.g. successful network authentication) that the handshake protocol is conducted with an authentic UICC."""" Similar considerations apply when the method in ETSI TS 102 484 [29] in clause 7 """"Secured APDU"""" with TLS handshake is used as is the case in the present document. And in the present solution for relay node security", the RN indeed verifies the authenticity of the USIM-RN by means of a successful RN attach procedure. However, the use of a self-signed UICC certificate, or no UICC certificate at all, is not allowed here as this would weaken the protection against certain attacks, cf. clause D.2.6 NOTE 4: It is proposed here that the RN assumes the role of TLS client in line with ETSI TS 102 484 [29], clause 7," on """"Secured APDU"""" with NOTE 5: One may want to limit the lifetime of a secure channel between USIM-RN and RN for security reasons. Suitable counters providing such a limit include a transaction counter"," cf. clause 5 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29]. Details can be found in stage 3 specifications NOTE 6: Having two USIMs on one UICC is a standard feature available today (but only one USIM can be active at a time in current 3GPP NOTE 7: The RN could distinguish a USIM-RN from a USIM-INI e.g. by the use of so-called """"Application Identifiers (AID)"""" for UICC Phase I: Procedures prior to the RN attach procedure (pre-shared key based For the psk-based case"," there may be some cases when skipping of Phase I attachment is possible. Such cases are outside the scope of the present Ep2. The RN platform secure environment and the UICC shall establish a Secure Channel between RN and USIM-RN according to ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7 """"Secured APDU"""" using a pre-shared key. Furthermore", the requirements in clause D.2.3 on 'USIM Binding Aspects' shall apply The pre-shared key shall be stored in the secure environment of the RN platform validated in the Preparation Phase, and the secure channel with the UICC shall terminate there. From the completion of this step onwards," all communication between the USIM-RN and the RN shall be protected by the Secure Channel The USIM-RN shall not engage in any communication with any entity prior to the completion of the establishment of the Secure Channel according to step Ep2 other than messages for establishing the Secure Channel according to ETSI TS 102 484 [29] clause 7 """"Secured APDU"""" Ep3. The RN may optionally establish a secure connection to an OAM server. Details can be found in clause D.2.5 Ep4. The RN shall detach from to the network if it attached for NOTE 8: The use of the pre-shared key variant requires that the RN is configured with this pre-shared key e.g. in the factory", or at the operator's premises or in the field during RN installation. The corresponding procedures are out of scope of the present document For the UICC, the regular personalization procedures are expected NOTE 9: One may want to limit the lifetime of a secure channel between USIM-RN and RN for security reasons. Suitable counters providing such a limit include a record counter, cf. clause 6.4 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29], or a transaction counter, cf. clause 5 of ETSI TS 102 484 [29]. Details can be found in stage 3 specifications Phase II: RN attach procedure (pre-shared key case and certificate-based It is required that a secure channel between RN and USIM-RN exists throughout the execution of phase II The RN shall perform the RN attach procedure for EPS as defined in TS 36.300 [30], using the USIM-RN. In addition, the following security-related steps shall be performed A1. If the USIM-RN is not already active the RN shall activate it and shall establish a new secure channel according to Ec5, Ec6 in the certificate-based case and Ep2 in the pre-shared key based case respectively. The RN shall use the IMSI (or a related GUTI) pertaining to the USIM-RN in the RN attach procedure NOTE 10: In the certificate-based case this IMSI differs from the one pertaining to the USIM-INI, therefore the network can distinguish the handling of the two USIMs A2. The S1 Initial UE message shall indicate that the attachment is for an RN. Upon receipt of this message the MME-RN shall run EPS AKA with the RN and the USIM-RN. The RN shall accept only authentication responses and keys in an RN attach procedure that were received from the USIM-RN over the Secure Channel A3. The MME-RN shall check from the RN-specific subscription data received from the HSS that the USIM-RN is permitted for use in RN attach procedures. When this is not the case, but the S1 Initial UE message indicated that the attachment is for an RN, the MME-RN shall reject the Attach request and indicate to the DeNB that the set-up has A4. The MME-RN and RN shall establish NAS security. Upon receipt of the S1 INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP message the DeNB and the RN shall set up AS security over Un as specified in the present document A5. The RN may establish a secure connection to an OAM server in this phase to complete the configuration. Details can be found in clause The RN start-up is now complete from a security point of view, and UEs can start attaching to the RN D.2.3 USIM Binding Aspects There shall be a one-to-one association between the USIM-RN and the RN In the pre-shared key case, this one-to-one association is ensured by the fact that the key that is pre-shared between the USIM-RN and the RN shall not be available in any other entity In the certificate-based case, this one-to-one association is ensured by - The UICC shall verify the RN identity, represented by the RN identity in the certificate, through the TLS handshake as part of the secure channel set-up, and shall check whether it coincides with the locally stored identity of the RN authorized to set up a secure channel with - the identity in an RN certificate shall be unique - a particular RN identity shall be available in only one UICC The procedures for managing the binding between USIM-RN and the RN are out of scope of the present document The UICC may know the identity of the RN authorized to set up a secure channel with the USIM-RN by configuration. The standard secure OTA mechanisms (TS 31.116 [31]) can be used to update the configuration of UICC and renew the stored identities if required NOTE: The RN identity is contained in the subject name of the RN certificate. It is described in detail in clause D.3.3 of the present document and in TS31.102 [13] D.2.4 Enrolment procedures for RNs This clause applies only to the certificate-based case The RN may enroll a device certificate as with macro eNBs according to TS 33.310 [6] prior to the RN attach procedure with the DeNB. This certificate may then be used for establishing the secure channel between RN and USIM The certificate enrolment procedure does not rely on the security at the AS level, but is secured at the application layer. It can be therefore executed before security on the Un interface has been established. However the RN requires IP connectivity for the enrolment procedure to be able to reach the Registration Authority RA The IP connectivity required for enrolment may be established in the (1) The RN may use offline means for enrolment purposes. No USIM is (2) The RN may attach to an eNB like a normal UE using a USIM, called USIM-INI, different from the one used in the RN attach procedure to the DeNB, called USIM-RN. No secure channel between RN and USIM-INI is In both cases, the network shall ensure that the destinations the RN can reach are restricted to only the PDN(s) where the RA (Registration Authority for the certificate enrolment) and other servers to be contacted during phase I, e.g. the OAM server are located. In case (2) this shall be ensured by restricting IP traffic originating from the RN and sent only to certain destinations (APNs). The restrictions are assumed to be part of the profile relating to the subscription associated with the USIM-INI D.2.5 Secure management procedures for RNs The requirements on communication between the OAM systems and the eNB from clause 5.3.2 shall apply for relay nodes in both phases I and II. The mechanisms used to fulfil these requirements shall include applying security association(s) that extend between the RN and an entity in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) or in an OAM domain trusted by the operator NOTE 1: No mechanisms used to fulfil these requirements are mandated in the present document. But example mechanisms are given in NOTE 3 below. NOTE 3 is followed by normative text, which applies if the example mechanisms are used NOTE 2: In case of offline configuration of the RN," the security measures used to fulfil the requirements from clause 5.3.2 are out of scope of the present document NOTE 3: Examples for mechanisms to secure OAM communication to and from - end-to-end security terminated within or just in front of the OAM - hop-by-hop security via SEG in EPC which is particularly suited for multiple management connections to separate OAM servers located within one """"management domain"""" If IKEv2/IPsec or TLS with authentication based on certificates is used for the security association(s)", the protocol profiles for IPsec in TS33.210 [5] and for IKEv2 and TLS in TS33.310 [6] and the certificate profiles given in TS33.310 [6] should be followed NOTE 4: As the USIM-INI can be accessed by any UE, an attacker can use the USIM-INI to connect to the APN used for OAM in phase I. In case of end-to-end security the OAM server itself has to be secured accordingly. In the hop-by-hop case the SEG can defend against attacks (e.g. DoS attacks) carried out via this channel The RN requires IP connectivity for the management procedure to be able to reach the OAM server For the pre-shared key case in Phase I, IP connectivity can be established after step Ep2 with the RN attaching to an eNB like a normal UE using the For the certificate-based case in Phase I, IP connectivity established for enrolment purposes according to clause D.2.4 may be re-used, or, if not available, it may be established in the same ways as described in clause Restrictions on the destinations the RN can reach shall apply if the communication with the OAM server prior to the RN attach procedure is based on USIM-INI. They shall be realized in the same way as described in clause D.2.6 Certificate and subscription handling Whenever the operator intends to prevent the RN from attaching to the network the operator shall bar the subscription relating to the USIM-RN in In the certificate-based case the barring of the subscription relating to the USIM-RN shall be performed also whenever the RN certificate has to be revoked, or whenever the UICC certificate has to be revoked and the RN is not configured to always check the UICC certificate against a CRL, cf In the pre-shared key case, the barring of the subscription relating to the USIM-RN may be performed also whenever the operator sees a risk that the pre-shared key between the USIM-RN and RN has been compromised NOTE 0: In the certificate-based case, checking the UICC certificate against a CRL and barring the subscription relating to the USIM-RN are not equivalent. The former could prevent the following attack while the latter could not: an attacker in possession of a compromised private key relating to the UICC certificate could get stolen RNs to work in his own network as then the attacker could use a fake UICC, with subscription data generated by himself towards the RN to set up a secure channel. Subscription barring would not be effective in the attacker's network while the CRL check by the RN would ensure that the RN cannot attach as an RN to a network other than the one of the operator who provisioned the root certificate in the RN. If the operator deems the risk of such an attack low he may configure his RNs to not use CRL checks NOTE 0a: In the pre-shared key case, the proprietary measures may need to consider the attack described in the preceding NOTE 0 The remainder of this clause applies only to the certificate-based case As described in clause D.2.2, step Ec6, the certificate validation client on the UICC verifies the signatures in the RN certificate chain up to the root certificate, but omits the check of revocation status and expiry time To achieve the same effect as checking RN certificate's revocation status and expiry time, the associated USIM-RN subscription shall be barred in the HSS. This process is called 'invalidation' in this document and is A certificate validation client on the RN shall check the verification of the signatures in the UICC certificate chain up to the root certificate as well as the expiry time. The revocation status of the UICC certificate should be checked by means of the CRL obtained by the RN in clause D.2.2 step Ec3. The CRL check is optional to support by the RN Further considerations on RN certificate and USIM-RN subscription handling By using the one-to-one binding of RN and USIM-RN, a part of the usual certificate handling is replaced by subscription handling," as explained Binding in network: The one-to-one binding of RN and USIM-RN shall be expressed by a one-to-one mapping of the RN identity in any certificate issued to the RN and the IMSI in the USIM-RN. The operator shall maintain a table with this mapping (the """"mapping table"""") Binding in UICC: cf. clause D.2.3 Lifetime: The subscription shall have a limit on its lifetime. When the lifetime of the subscription is exceeded the subscription shall be barred in the HSS. The lifetime shall not be greater than the lifetime of the RN certificate. The latter is not checked in the UICC", cf. clause D.2.2 RN Certificate revocation and invalidation: Whenever the operator decides that the RN certificate shall no longer be used for setting up a secure channel with the USIM-RN the operator does not use CRLs or OCSP, but shall retrieve the IMSI associated with the subject name in the RN certificate and bar the subscription corresponding to the IMSI in the HSS. The certificate shall also be revoked, but the operator does not need to use CRLs or OCSP in this context. This implies that no new certificate shall be issued for the same RN identity from that point onwards. In case the RN certificate is also used for other purposes, e.g. for protecting an OAM connection, then, additionally, the usual PKI revocation procedures apply RN compromise: If the operator has reason to believe that an RN has been compromised the RN certificate shall be invalidated and revoked as RN Certificate renewal: This process may be used as normal as long as the RN identity in the RN certificate remains the same NOTE 1: Certificate renewal with private key change may be useful even if the UICC does not check the expiry time of the certificate as, in this way, the use of the private key can be limited if desired NOTE 2: As the UICC has no clock it cannot check the expiry time and hence, the RN could also use an expired certificate in the secure channel set-up. As the certificate is only checked by the UICC for RN platform authentication in the secure channel set-up this is not a problem as long as the corresponding private key has not left the secure environment of the RN. More generally, if there is a risk that it has been compromised the operator will bar the corresponding subscription in the HSS. The use of the certificate is limited by the lifetime of the subscription bound to the RN However, a UICC can be re-used with a different RN after having been re-configured with a different RN identity D.3 Secure channel profiles The clause D.3 profiles the algorithms to be used on the APDU secure channel, cf. ETSI TS102484 [29]. In addition it specifies the profiles for the different key agreement methods For the case when certificates are used for key agreement, the profiles are given for the TLS handshake used to provide key material for the Master SA of the secure channel between USIM-RN and RN, and for the certificates used in UICC and RN for mutual authentication during TLS handshake. For the psk case requirements on the key agreement with pre-shared keys are given D.3.2 APDU secure channel profile For communication between the USIM-RN and the RN a secure channel according to the APDU secure channel as specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] shall be used. Further detailing of the secure channel is given in TS31.102 [13] For encryption," AES-CBC as specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] shall be mandatory to support. Other encryption algorithms specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] may be supported. The algorithm """"3DES - outer CBC using 2 keys"""" shall not be used NOTE 1: The algorithm """"3DES - outer CBC using 2 keys"""" is outdated For integrity protection", AES-CMAC as specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] shall be mandatory to support. Other integrity protection algorithms specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] shall not be used NOTE 2: The algorithm CRC32 is for redundancy check only," and not a cryptographic checksum. The algorithm """"ANSI Retail MAC"""" is not fit for long-term usage in the scope of the present document D.3.3 Key agreement based on certificate exchange The key agreement for the certificate exchange case shall follow the mechanism """"Certificate exchange"""" as specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] During key agreement based on certificate exchange a TLS handshake is used to provide key material for the Master SA of the APDU secure channel between USIM-RN and RN The TLS profile shall follow the profile given in Annex E of TS33.310 [6] with the following restrictions and extensions - the support of the ciphersuite mandatory for TLS1.1 as described in TS33.310 [6] is not required - the support of fallback to TLS1.0 as described in TS33.310 [6] is - neither UICC nor RN shall use TLS session resumption D.3.3.2 Common profile for RN and UICC certificate The certificate profile for both RN and UICC certificates shall follow the TLS entity certificate profile given in clause 6.1.3a of TS33.310 [6] with the following restrictions and extensions - the support of the SHA-1 algorithm for use before signing the certificate as described in TS 33.310 [6] is not required - the support of public key length of 1024-bit is not required - only the subject name format with """"(C=<country>)", O=<Organization Name>," CN=<Some distinguishing name>"""" is mandatory to support D.3.3.3 RN certificate profile The RN certificate is used as client certificate in the TLS handshake between RN and UICC The certificate profile for the RN certificate shall follow clause D.3.3.2 of the present document with the following restrictions and extensions - the subject name shall be unique within all subject names issued by CAs under the same root CA - the subject name may additionally contain the attribute - the support of the countryName (C) and serialNumber attributes in the subject name is mandatory NOTE 1: The usage of the countryName (C) and serialNumber attributes can support the operator in generating a unique identity for an RN - the CRL distribution point is not used if the RN certificate is only used in the setup of the secure channel with the UICC. Therefore the CRL distribution point is optional in this case NOTE 2: It may be desired to deploy the same RN certificate also for RN platform authentication to other network elements of the operator e.g. if TLS with mutual authentication is used for an OAM connection. The profile given above is intended to allow such usage. Regarding the implementation of certificate handling in the UICC it should be noted that for this additional usage of the RN certificate the existence of additional fields in the certificate is possible", e.g. of the subjectAltName and/or the CRL distribution point, which are not relevant for the secure channel between RN and D.3.3.4 UICC certificate profile The UICC certificate is used as server certificate in the TLS handshake between RN and UICC The certificate profile for the UICC certificate shall follow clause D.3.3.2 of the present document with the following additional provisions - the CRL distribution point in the UICC certificate is optional NOTE 1: The CRL distribution point and the support for CRL infrastructure for the UICC certificate is only needed if the revocation check of the UICC certificate is performed during setup of the secure channel (cf. clause D.2.6) NOTE 2: In common TLS usage, the RN learns the UICC certificate only during TLS handshake, when the IP connectivity to the core network using USIM-INI may no longer be available. Thus the CRL distribution point for CRLs having UICC certificates in scope would be known too late to allow the RN to retrieve an up-to-date CRL from the network. By reading the UICC certificate from the UICC before the establishment of the secure channel starts, the RN may learn the CRL distribution point while it still has IP connectivity based on USIM-INI," cf. step Ec3 in clause D.2.2. For access to the UICC certificate see the definition of the EF for UICC certificate D.3.4 Key agreement for pre-shared key (psk) case The key agreement for the psk case shall follow the mechanism """"Strong Pre shared Keys - Proprietary Pre-agreed keys"""" as specified in ETSI TS102484 [29]. The pre-shared key shall be used directly to derive a Master secret for the Master SA NOTE: The above requirement includes that the pre-shared key fulfills the requirements for WeakKey=0 as specified in clause 7.2 of ETSI D.3.5 Identities used in key agreement The key agreement mechanisms specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] produce a value Ks_Local_Ref", which is a reference to Ks_local. It is transferred from the RN to the UICC during the Master SA setup and is used as input to the derivation of the 256 bit Master secret (MS) of the Master SA in the Ks_Local_Ref is specified in ETSI TS102484 [29] as the concatenation of Ks_Local_Ref = Terminal_ID || Terminal_appli_ID || UICC_ID || The identities used in the scope of the present document for Ks_Local_Ref are specified as follows - UICC_ID: This unique identifier for the UICC shall be the ICCID for the UICC as specified in ETSI TS102221 [32] NOTE: The UICC_ID may be read by the RN from the UICC before establishment of the secure channel - UICC_appli_ID: This unique identifier for the UICC application that hosts the UICC endpoint shall be the USIM-RN AID as specified in - Terminal_ID: This unique identifier for the RN shall be the subject name of the RN certificate as specified in clause D.3.3.3. In the psk case, where no certificate is used, the same definition as for the certificate exchange case shall apply - Terminal_appli_ID: This unique identifier for the application that hosts the RN side endpoint shall be set to the UTF-8 encoded string NOTE: UP integrity protection is not supported in LTE-LTE Dual This clause describes the security functions necessary to support a UE that is simultaneously connected to more than one eNB for the architectures for dual connectivity as described in TS 36.300 [30]. The security functions are described in the context of the functions controlling the dual E.1.2 Dual Connectivity architecture with an SeNB For dual connectivity architecture, which hosts PDCP in MeNB the security functions described for the single connectivity mode in this specification are sufficient. The reason for that they are sufficient, is that the end point for the encryption and integrity protection remains in the MeNB. That is, from a security point of view, the PDCP packets are still processed in the same locations in the architecture; they have only travelled a different path via the SeNB The remainder of the present clause deals with dual connectivity between an MeNB and an SeNB with the architecture as shown in Figure E.1. 2-1 Figure E.1.2-1: Dual Connectivity architecture with an SeNB When the MeNB establishes security between an SeNB and the UE for the first time for a given AS security context shared between the MeNB and the UE the MeNB generates the S-KeNB for the SeNB and sends it to the SeNB over the X2-C. To generate the S-KeNB, the MeNB associates a counter, called an SCG Counter, with the current AS security context. The SCG Counter is used as freshness input into S-KeNB derivations as described in the clause E.2.4, and guarantees, together with the other provisions in the present clause E, that the KUPenc and the KUPint derived from the same S-KeNB is not re-used with the same input parameters as defined in Annex B of the present specification. The latter would result in key-stream re-use. The MeNB sends the value of the SCG Counter to the UE over the RRC signalling path when it is required to generate a new S-KeNB The communication established between the SeNB and the UE is protected at the PDCP layer using the AS Secondary Cell security context, or AS SC security context for short. The AS SC security context includes parameters as the AS security context described in clause 7 of the present specification, the S-KeNB replaces the KeNB. The UE and the SeNB derives the KUPenc and the KUPint from the S-KeNB as described in clause A.7, cf E.1.3 Dual Connecivity architecture with an SgNB Annex E.3 describes the security functions necessary to support a UE that is simultaneously connected to eNB as master and gNB as secondary for EN-DC dual connectivity. The description in Annex E.3 is focused on the difference from dual connectivity in E-UTRAN described in Annex E.2. The a) with dual connectivity between an MeNB and an SgNB compared to between an MeNB and an SeNB is that in the former case a RRC signalling connection is allowed between the UE and the SgNB. Such a RRC signalling connection shall be integrity protected in addition to the ciphered with the chosen ciphering algorithm b) EPS bearers from the core network to the SgNB may be Split across the radio resources of both MeNB and SgNB (as well as being Non-Split and only using radio resources of the SgNB); and c) for bearers whose PDCP terminates in the MeNB, the security functions described for the single connectivity mode in this specification shall be used, while for bearers whose PDCP terminates in the SgNB, the security algorithm given in clause E.3.10.1 with key derived as given in clause A.19 shall be used Figure E.1.3-1 Offload architecture for EN-DC When the MeNB establishes security between a SgNB and the UE for the first time for a given AS security context shared between the MeNB and the UE the MeNB generates the S-KgNB (exactly as it would generate an S-KeNB) for the SgNB and sends it to the SgNB over the X2-C. The SCG Counter is also used as freshness input into S-KgNB derivations as described in the clause E.2.4, and guarantees, together with the other provisions in the present clause E, that the integrity and ciphering keys used at the SgNB derived from the same S-KgNB are not re-used with the same input parameters to avoid in key-stream re-use and provide replay protection. The MeNB sends the value of the SCG Counter to the UE over the LTE RRC signalling path when it is required to generate a new S-KgNB The communication established between the SgNB and the UE is protected at the PDCP layer using the SgNB Secondary Cell security context, or SgNB SC security context for short. The SgNB SC security context includes S-KgNB the key used as input to the UP confidentiality algorithm, KSgNB-UP-enc the key used as input to the UP integrity algorithm, KSgNB-UP-int, the key used as the input to the RRC confidentiality algorithm, KSgNB-RRC-enc, the key used as the input for the RRC integrity algorithm, KSgNB-RRC-int, the identifiers of the selected cryptographic algorithms and counters used for replay protection. The UE and the SgNB derives the integrity and ciphering keys from the S-KgNB as described in clause A.19, cf. also E.3.4.2 E.2 Dual connectivity offload architecture between eNBs E.2.1 Protection of the X2 reference point The control plane signalling between MeNB and SeNB, that includes the transfer of the S-KeNB from the MeNB to the SeNB, over the X2 reference point shall be confidentiality and integrity protected using X2-C security protection as described in clause 5.3.4a and clause 11 of the present specification. Any user plane data between MeNB and SeNB over X2 reference point shall be confidentiality and integrity protected using X2-U security protection as described in clause 5.3.4 and clause 12 of the present E.2.2 Addition and modification of DRB in SeNB When executing the SeNB Addition procedure (i.e. the initial offload of one or more radio bearers to the SeNB), or the SeNB Modification procedure requiring an update of S-KeNB, the MeNB shall derive an S- KeNB as defined in clause E.2.4, which results in a fresh S-KeNB. The MeNB shall forward the generated S-KeNB to the SeNB during the SeNB Addition procedure or SeNB Modification procedure requiring key update Note: Refer to TS 36.300 [30] for definition of the SeNB Addition and The SeNB shall derive a key KUPenc and KUPin from the received S-KeNB as defined in clause E.2.4 of the present specification and use it for all radio bearers that were being added At any point of time, the same KUPenc is used for encrypting all radio bearers between the SeNB and the UE and the same KUPint is used for integrity protection of all radio bearers between the SeNB and the UE. Once the KUPenc and the KUPin have been derived from the S-KeNB, the SeNB and UE may delete the S-KeNB The MeNB shall provide the value of the SCG Counter used in the derivation of the S-KeNB to the UE in the SeNB Addition procedure adding the radio bearer(s) in the UE. The UE shall derive the S-KeNB, KUPenc and KUPint as described in clause E.2.4 When executing the procedure for adding subsequent radio bearer(s) to the same SeNB, the MeNB shall, for each new radio bearer, assign a radio bearer identity that has not previously been used since the last S-KeNB change If the MeNB cannot allocate an unused radio bearer identity for a new radio bearer in the SeNB, due to radio bearer identity space exhaustion, the MeNB shall increment the SCG Counter and compute a fresh S-KeNB, and then shall perform a SeNB Modification procedure to update the S-KeNB. The MeNB may choose to update the S-KeNB instead of assigning a new radio bearer identity even when the latter would have been possible If the SeNB receives a new S-KeNB from the MeNB during the SeNB Modification procedure, the SeNB shall use the KUPenc and KUPint derived from the new S-KeNB as encryption key and integrity key for all the radio If the UE receives a new SCG Counter in SeNB Addition/Modification procedure, then the UE shall use the KUPenc derived from the new S-KeNB, as the encryption key and integrity key for all the radio bearer(s) established with the SeNB When the last radio bearer on the SeNB is released, the SeNB Release procedure is performed; the SeNB and the UE shall delete the KUPenc. and KUPint . The SeNB and UE shall also delete the S-KeNB, if it was not E.2.3 Activation of encryption/decryption The DRB offload procedure with activation of encryption/decryption follows the steps outlined on the Figure E.2.3-1 Figure E.2.3-1. SeNB encryption/decryption activation 1. The UE and the MeNB establish the RRC connection 2. The MeNB decides to offload the DRB(s) to the SeNB. The MeNB sends SeNB Addition Request to the SeNB over the X2-C to negotiate the available resources, configuration, and algorithms at the SeNB. The MeNB computes and delivers the S-KeNB to the SeNB as necessary. UE EPS security capability shall also be sent to SeNB. The SeNB Addition Request message shall additionally include UP integrity protection policy (either the one received from other network entities or the locally configured one if no UP integrity protection policy is received from other network entities) 3. The SeNB allocates the necessary resources and chooses the ciphering algorithm which has the highest priority from its configured list and is also present in the UE EPS security capability. If the UE supports user plane integrity protection, then the SeNB shall use the UP IP policy received from the MeNB together with the UE EPS security capabilities (i.e. bit EIA7) to determine whether to activate UP integrity protection. The SeNB shall activate UP integrity protection per DRB according to the UP integrity protection policy if it is received and shall indicate that to the UE 4. The SeNB sends SeNB Addition Request Acknowledge to the MeNB indicating availability of requested resources and the identifiers for the selected ciphering algorithm and integrity algorithm to serve the requested DRB for the UE 5. The MeNB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Request to the UE instructing it to configure a new DRB for the SeNB. The MeNB shall include the SCG Counter parameter to indicate that the UE shall compute the S-KeNB for the SeNB, the KUPenc and the KUPint associated with the assigned bearer. The MeNB forwards the UE configuration parameters (which contains the algorithm identifier received from the SeNB in step 4) to the UE (see clauseE.2.4.3 for further details) NOTE: Since the message is sent over the RRC connection between the MeNB and the UE, it is integrity protected using the KRRCint of the MeNB. Hence the SCG Counter cannot be tampered with, and the UE can assume that it is fresh 6. The UE accepts the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Command and shall compute the S-KeNB for the SeNB. The UE shall also compute the KUPenc and the KUPint for the associated assigned DRB on the SeNB. The UE sends the RRC Reconfiguration Complete to the MeNB. The UE activates encryption/decryption and integrity protection once S-KeNB and KUPenc 7. MeNB sends SeNB Reconfiguration Complete to the SeNB over the X2-C to inform SeNB configuration result. On receipt of this message, SeNB may activate encryption/decryption and integrity protection with UE. If SeNB does not activate encryption/decryption or integrity protection with the UE at this stage, SeNB shall activate encryption/decryption and integrity protection upon receiving the Random Access request from E.2.4 Derivation of keys for the DRBs in the SeNB E.2.4.1 SCG Counter maintenance The MeNB shall associate a 16-bit counter, SCG Counter, with the EPS AS The SCG Counter is used when computing the S-KeNB. The UE and the MeNB shall treat the SCG Counter as a fresh input to S-KeNB derivation. That is the UE assumes that the MeNB provides a fresh SCG Counter each time and does not need to verify the freshness of the SCG Counter NOTE: An attacker cannot, over the air modify the SCG Counter and force re-use of the same SCG Counter. The reason for this is that the SCG Counter is delivered over the RRC connection between the MeNB and the UE, and this connection is both integrity protected and The MeNB maintains the value of the counter SCG Counter for a duration of the current AS security context between UE and MeNB. The UE does not need to maintain the SCG Counter after it has computed the S-KeNB since the MeNB provides the UE with the current SCG Counter value when the UE needs to compute a new S-KeNB The MeNB that supports the DRB offload shall set the SCG Counter to '0' when the KeNB in the associated AS security context is established. The MeNB shall set the SCG Counter to '1' after the first calculated S- KeNB and monotonically increment it for each additional calculated S- KeNB. The SCG Counter value '0' is hence used to calculate the first S-KeNB If the MeNB decides to turn off the offload connection and later decides to re-start the offloading to the same SeNB, the SCG Counter value shall keep increasing, thus keeping the computed S-KeNB fresh The MeNB shall refresh the KeNB of the AS security context associated with the SCG Counter before the SCG Counter wraps around. Re-freshing the KeNB is done using intra cell handover as described in clause 7.2.9.3 of the present specification. When this KeNB is refreshed, the SCG Counter is reset to '0' as defined above E.2.4.2 Security key derivation The UE and MeNB shall derive the security key S-KeNB of the target SeNB as defined in Annex A.15 of the present specification The addition to the LTE key hierarchy with derivation of the S-KeNB is shown on Figure E.2.4.2-1 Figure E.2.4.2-1 Addition to the Key Hierarchy for the SeNB The SeNB and the UE shall further derive the ciphering key KUPenc for ciphering and the integrity key KUPint for integrity protection of the User Plane over the DRB. This derivation is performed according to Annex A.7 using the S-KeNB as the input key and the input string S formed using the IDs of the SeNB selected algorithm to the KDF E.2.4.3 Negotiation of security algorithms When establishing one or more DRBs for a UE at the SeNB, as shown on Figure E.2.3-1, the MeNB shall forward the UE EPS security capabilities associated with the UE in the SeNB Addition/Modification procedure Upon receipt of this message, the SeNB shall identify the AS encryption algorithm with highest priority in the locally configured priority list of AS encryption algorithms that is also present in the received UE EPS security capabilities and include an indicator for the locally identified AS encryption algorithm in SeNB Addition/Modification Request Acknowledge Upon receipt of this message, if integrity protection is activated then the SeNB shall identify the AS integrity algorithm with highest priority in the locally configured priority list of AS integrity algorithms that is also present in the received UE EPS security capabilities and include an indicator for the locally identified AS integrity algorithm in SeNB The MeNB shall forward the indication to the UE during the RRCConnectionReconfiguration procedure that establishes the SCG DRBs in the UE. The UE shall use the indicated encryption algorithm and integrity algorithm for the SCG DRBs NOTE 1: The UE uses one encryption algorithm for encryption of SRB and any potential DRB(s) established with MeNB, and a same or different encryption algorithm for encryption of DRB(s) established with NOTE 2: The UE uses one integrity algorithm for integrity of SRB and any potential DRB(s) established with MeNB," and a same or different integrity algorithm for integrity protection of DRB(s) established E.2.5.1 S-KeNB update triggers The system supports update of the S-KeNB.

This retains the two-hop security property for X2-handovers E.2.5.2 S-KeNB update procedure If the MeNB receives a request for S-KeNB update from the SeNB or decides on its own to perform S-KeNB update (see clause E.2.5.1), the MeNB shall compute a fresh S-KeNB and increment the SCG Counter, as defined in clause E.2.4. Then the MeNB shall perform a SeNB Modification procedure to deliver the fresh S-KeNB to the SeNB. The MeNB shall provide the value of the SCG Counter used in the derivation of the S-KeNB to the UE in an integrity protected RRC procedure. The UE shall derive the S-KeNB and KUPenc as described in clause E.2.4 Whenever the UE or SeNB start using a fresh S-KeNB, they shall re-calculate the KUPenc and the KUPint from the fresh S-KeNB During S1 and X2 handover, the offloaded DRB connection between the UE and the SeNB is released, and the AS SC security context at SeNB and UE can be deleted since it shall not be used again E.2.7 Periodic local authentication procedure SeNB may request the MeNB to execute a counter check procedure specified in clause 7.5 of this specification to verify the value of the PDCP COUNT(s) associated with DRB(s) offloaded to the SeNB. To accomplish this, the SeNB shall communicate this request, including the expected values of PDCP COUNT(s) and associated radio bearer identities (which are identified by E RAB Id(s) in X2AP), to the MeNB over the X2-C If the MeNB receives a RRC counter check response from the UE that contains one or several PDCP COUNT values (possibly associated with both MeNB and SeNB), the MeNB may release the connection or report the difference of the PDCP COUNT values to the serving MME or O&M server for further traffic analysis for e.g. detecting the attacker E.2.8 Radio link failure recovery Since the MeNB holds the control plane functions even in dual connectivity the UE runs the RRC re-establishment procedure with the MeNB as specified in clause 7.4.3 of the present specification NOTE: During the RRC re-establishment procedure, the DRB(s) offloaded between the UE and the SeNB is (are) released. If MeNB still want to offload DRB(s) to SeNB, SeNB addition is performed as specified E.2.9 Avoiding key stream reuse caused by DRB type change When a MCG DRB changes to SCG DRB and then changes back to MCG DRB, the key stream reuse is possible. MeNB shall implement a mechanism to prevent key E.3 Dual connectivity architecture between a MeNB and a SgNB E.3.1 Protection of the X2 reference point The protection of X2 interface shall use the X2-C security and X2-U security as described in clause E.2.1 of the present document E.3.2 Addition and modification of DRBs and/or SRB in SgNB The S-KeNB that is used for dual connectivity between eNBs (see clause E.2.3) is also used as the root for the security context at the SgNB. When used in the contexts of dual connectivity with an SgNB, the key shall be called an S-KgNB, i.e. the MeNB generates and forwards an S-KgNB to the SgNB during the SgNB Addition procedure or SgNB Modification procedure NOTE 1: Refer to TS 36.300 [30] for definition of the SgNB Addition and Similarly, the MeNB handles the SCG Counter due to interactions with a SgNB as described in clause E.2.2 for interactions with SeNBs, i.e. this is a single shared SCG Counter for SeNBs and SgNBs and provides the same value of SCG Counter used to the UE and ensure that fresh radio bearer identities are used or the S-KgNB is refreshed When the SgNB receives an S-KgNB in a SgNB Addition/Modification procedure the SgNB shall derive and store KSgNB-UP-enc and KSgNB-UP-int, as well as KSgNB-RRC-int and KSgNB-RRC-enc if an SRB is to be added as described in clause E.3.4.2 from the received S-KgNB. These freshly derived keys are then used to protect all the radio bearer(s) that use the PDCP of the SgNB Any previous such keys shall be deleted. If all the keys were derived, then the S-KgNB may be deleted If the UE receives a new SCG Counter in SgNB Addition/Modification procedure, then the UE shall derive a new S-KgNB from this SCG Counter and use KSgNB-UP-enc, KSgNB-UP-int, KSgNB-RRC-int and KSgNB-RRC-enc derived from the new S-KgNB, as the keys to protect all the radio bearer(s) using the PDCP of the SgNB. If all the keys were derived, then the S-KgNB may be deleted in the UE When the SgNB Release procedure releases the last radio bearer on the SgNB , the SgNB and the UE shall delete the KSgNB-UPenc, K SgNB-UP-int, KSgNB-RRC int and KSgNB-RRC-enc. The SgNB and UE shall also delete the S-KgNB, if it was not deleted earlier The UP integrity protection policy indicates whether UP integrity protection shall be activated or not for all DRBs belonging to that E-RAB The MME provides the UP integrity protection policy for each E-RAB to the MeNB during the Attach/Dedicated bearer activation/Dedicated bearer modification procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. The MME receives UP integrity protection policy from SMF+PGW-C via SGW E.3.3 Activation of encryption/decryption/integrity protection of DRBs and encryption/decryption/integrity protection of SRB The dual connectivity procedure with activation of encryption/decryption and integrity protection of Split and/or Non-Split SgNB terminated DRB(s) (i.e. a DRB for which PDCP is located in the SgNB) and/or activation of encryption/decryption and integrity protection of an SgNB terminated SRB (i.e. a SRB for which PDCP is located in the SgNB) follows the steps outlined on the Figure E.3.3-1 Figure E.3.3-1. SgNB encryption/decryption and integrity protection 1. The UE and the MeNB establish the RRC connection 2. Before the MeNB decides to use dual connectivity for some DRB(s) and/or an SRB with the SgNB, the MeNB shall check whether the UE has NR capability and is authorized to access NR. The MeNB sends SgNB Addition Request to the SgNB over the X2-C to negotiate the available resources configuration, and algorithms at the SgNB. . The MeNB computes and delivers the S-KgNB to the SgNB if a new key is needed. The UE NR security capability shall also be sent to SgNB. The SgNB Addition Request message shall additionally include UP integrity protection policy (either the one received from other network entities or the locally configured one if no UP integrity protection policy is received from other network entities) and an indication which indicates whether the UE can support UP integrity protection or not 3. The SgNB allocates the necessary resources and chooses the ciphering algorithm and integrity algorithms for the DRB(s) and SRB if an SRB is to be established which has the highest priority from its configured list and is also present in the UE NR security capability. If a new S KgNB was delivered to the SgNB, then the SgNB calculates KSgNB-UP-int (if needed) and KSgNB-UP-enc as well as KSgNB-RRC-int and KSgNB-RRC-enc if an SRB is to be established. If the UE supports user plane integrity protection based on the received indication, then the SgNB shall use the UP IP policy received from the MeNB to determine whether to activate UP integrity protection. The SgNB shall activate UP integrity protection per DRB according to the UP integrity protection policy if it is received and shall indicate that to the UE. If the SgNB does not receive the UP IP policy and the indication, then the SgNB shall not activate UP IP 4. The SgNB sends SgNB Addition Request Acknowledge to the MeNB indicating availability of requested resources and the identifiers for the selected algorithm(s) to serve the requested DRBs and/or SRB for 5. The MeNB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Request to the UE instructing it to configure the new DRBs and/or SRB for the SgNB. The MeNB shall include the SCG Counter parameter to indicate that the UE shall compute the S-KgNB for the SgNB if a new key is needed. The MeNB forwards the UE configuration parameters (which contains the algorithm identifier(s) and UP integrity indication received from the SgNB in step 4) to the UE (see clauseE.3.4.3 for further details) NOTE 3: Since the message is sent over the RRC connection between the MeNB and the UE, it is integrity protected using the KRRCint of the MeNB. Hence the SCG Counter cannot be tampered with, and the UE can assume that it is fresh 6. The UE accepts the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Command. The UE shall compute the S-KgNB for the SgNB if an SCG Counter parameter was included. The UE shall also compute KSgNB-UP-enc and KSgNB-UP-int (if needed) as well as KSgNB-RRC-int and KSgNB-RRC-enc for the associated assigned DRBs and/or SRB. The UE sends the RRC Reconfiguration Complete to the MeNB. The UE activates the chosen encryption/decryption and integrity protection at this point 7. MeNB sends SgNB Reconfiguration Complete to the SgNB over the X2-C to inform the SgNB of the configuration result. On receipt of this message, SgNB may activate the chosen encryption/decryption and integrity protection with UE. If SgNB does not activate encryption/decryption and integrity protection with the UE at this stage, SgNB shall activate encryption/decryption and integrity protection upon receiving the Random Access request from the UE E.3.4 Derivation of keys for RBs with PDCP in the SgNB E.3.4.1 SCG Counter maintenance The same SCG Counter is used for both SeNB and SgNB and the handling for SgNBs follow the procedures for SeNB given in E.2.4.1 E.3.4.2 Security key derivation The UE and MeNB shall derive the security key S-KgNB of the target SgNB as defined in Annex A.15 of the present specification. KSgNB-UP-enc, KSgNB-UP int, KSgNB-RRC-int and KSgNB-RRC-enc are derived from the S-KgNB both at the SgNB side and the UE side as shown on Figure E.3.4.2-1 using the function given in Annex A.19 Figure E.3.4.2-1 Addition to the Key Hierarchy for the SgNB E.3.4.3 Negotiation of security algorithms The UE NR security capabilities shall be indicated to the network using a new IE so that the support of EPS and NR algorithms can evolve independently. The UE shall send the UE NR security capabilities to the MME in Attach Request and (when possibly changing MME) TAU Request. To enable the usage of NR EN-DC with an MME that does not understand the UE NR security capabilities in the new IE, such an MME will drop the UE NR security capabilities and never save them in its UE context. An eNB that does not receive the UE NR security capabilities shall use the E-UTRAN security capabilities algorithms to create the supported UE NR security capabilities (see Annex E.10.3.2 for more details) An MME that has the UE NR security capabilities shall send the UE NR security capabilities to the eNB in the S1-Initial Context Set-up message At S1-handover if the target MME receives the UE NR security capabilities from the source MME, the target MME shall send the UE NR security capabilities to the target eNB in the S1-AP Handover Request At X2 handover, if the source eNB has the UE NR security capabilities, the source eNB shall send the UE NR security capabilities to the target eNB These UE NR security capabilities should be the same as received from the MME on the S1 interface After a handover, it is possible that an eNB may have not received the UE NR security capabilities as the UE may have just been handed over from an eNB or MME that does not support the UE NR security capabilities. To overcome such a possible problem, the eNB shall create the UE NR security capabilities from the supported E-UTRAN security algorithms. To do this the eNB shall use the mapping between the E-UTRAN security algorithms and NR security algorithms as per Annex E.3.10.2. When adding SgNB while establishing an EN-DC connection, the MeNB shall send these created UE NR security capabilities to the SgNB. Other than for adding an SgNB, the created UE NR security capabilities shall not be sent from the MeNB A target eNB that has received the UE NR security capabilities during handover shall include the UE NR security capabilities in the S1-PATH If an MME does not receive the UE NR security capabilities in the S1-PATH SWITCH-REQUEST message from the target eNB to which the UE is connected to or if an MME becomes aware that the eNB doesn't know the UE NR security capabilities after an S1-handover, the MME should send the UE NR security capabilities to the target eNB via the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message as specified in TS 36.413 [42], and the the target eNB shall store the UE NR security capabilities in the UE context When establishing one or more DRBs and/or a SRB for a UE at the SgNB, as shown on Figure E.3.3-1, the MeNB shall send the UE NR security capabilities associated with the UE in the SgNB Addition/Modification procedure. Upon receipt of this message, the SgNB shall identify the needed algorithm(s) with highest priority in the locally configured priority list of algorithms that is also present in the received UE NR security capabilities and include an indicator for the locally identified algorithm(s) in SgNB Addition/Modification Request Acknowledge The MeNB shall forward the indication to the UE during the RRCConnectionReconfiguration procedure that establishes the SgNB terminated DRBs and/or SgNB terminated SRB in the UE. The UE shall use the indicated encryption algorithms for the SgNB terminated DRBs and/or SgNB terminated SRB and the indicated integrity algorithm for the SgNB terminated SRB and/or SgNB terminated DRBs E.3.5.1 S-KgNB update triggers The system supports update of the S-KgNB. The MeNB may update the S-KgNB for any reason by using the S-KgNB update procedure defined in clause E.3.5.2 of the current specification. The SgNB shall request the MeNB to update the S-KgNB over the X2-C, when uplink or downlink PDCP COUNTs are about to wrap around for any of the SgNB terminated DRBs or SgNB terminated If the MeNB re-keys its currently active KeNB in an AS security context the MeNB shall update any S-KgNB associated with that AS security context. This retains the two-hop security property for X2-handovers E.3.5.2 S-KgNB update procedure If the MeNB receives a request for S-KgNB update from the SgNB or decides on its own to perform S-KgNB update (see clause E.3.5.1), the MeNB shall compute a fresh S-KgNB and increment the SCG Counter, as defined in clause E.2.4. Then the MeNB shall perform a SgNB Modification procedure to deliver the fresh S-KgNB to the SgNB. The MeNB shall provide the value of the SCG Counter used in the derivation of the S-KgNB to the UE in an integrity protected RRC procedure. The UE shall derive the S-KgNB as described in clause E.2.4 Whenever the UE or SgNB start using a fresh S-KgNB, they shall re calculateKSgNB-UP-int, KSgNB-UP-enc, KSgNB-RRC-int and KSgNB-RRC-enc from During S1 and X2 handover, the DRB connection between the UE and the SgNB shall be released, and the AS SC security context at SgNB and UE shall be deleted since it shall not be used again E.3.7 Periodic local authentication procedure SgNB may request the MeNB to execute a counter check procedure specified in clause 7.5 of this specification to verify the value of the PDCP COUNT(s) associated with DRB(s) offloaded to the SgNB. To accomplish this, the SgNB shall communicate this request, including the expected values of PDCP COUNT(s) and associated radio bearer identities (which are identified by E RAB Id(s) in X2AP), to the MeNB over the X2-C If the MeNB receives a RRC counter check response from the UE that contains one or several PDCP COUNT values (possibly associated with both MeNB and SgNB), the MeNB may release the connection or report the difference of the PDCP COUNT values to the serving MME or O&M server for further traffic analysis for e.g. detecting the attacker E.3.8 Radio link failure recovery Since the MeNB holds the control plane functions even in dual connectivity the UE runs the RRC re-establishment procedure with the MeNB as specified in clause 7.4.3 of the present specification NOTE: During the RRC re-establishment procedure, the DRB(s) offloaded between the UE and the SgNB is (are) released. If MeNB still want to offload DRB(s) to SgNB, SgNB addition is performed as specified E.3.9 Avoiding key stream reuse caused by DRB type change When a DRB changes from a MeNB terminated DRB (i.e. a DRB for which PDCP is located in the MeNB) to a SgNB terminated DRB and then changes back to a MeNB terminated DRB, then key stream reuse is possible. MeNB shall implement a mechanism to prevent key stream reuse E.3.10 Protection of the traffic between the UE and SgNB The ciphering protection shall be applied between the UE and gNB at the PDCP layer. The integrity protection shall be applied to the SRB and DRB between the UE and gNB at the PDCP layer The inputs to the integrity and ciphering algorithms are the same as the input for the algorithms in LTE.

A description of the architectural concept of IOPS is given in informative Annex K of TS 23.401 This annex provides security guidelines for the operation of Public Safety networks in the no backhaul (to Macro EPC) scenario using the Local EPC The Local EPC approach assumes that an IOPS network can comprise either - A Local EPC and a single isolated IOPS-capable eNB (or a deployable IOPS-capable eNB), which may be co-located or have connectivity to the - A Local EPC and two or more IOPS-capable eNBs (or deployable IOPS capable eNBs), which have connectity to a single Local EPC A Local EPC includes at least MME, SGW/PGW and HSS functionality The Public Safety network operator dedicates a PLMN identity to IOPS mode of operation which is broadcast in System Information by the eNB when IOPS mode is in operation.

The same applies in the event of a loss of backhaul communications and a transition of the IOPS capable eNB to support Isolated E-UTRAN operation for a population of IOPS The USIM application dedicated exclusively for IOPS operation uses a distinct set of security credentials separate from those used for 'normal' operation. These credentials are configured in the Local HSS and in the UICC prior to the commencement of IOPS operation The USIM application dedicated exclusively for IOPS operation, in an IOPS enabled UE, has a distinct set of security credentials which contains at - A permanent key K (uniquely assigned for IOPS operation) - The PLMN identity assigned for IOPS network operation - An IMSI (uniquely assigned for IOPS operation) - Access Class status of 11 or 15 (subject to regional/national regulatory requirements and operator policy) These credentials are provisioned in all Local HSSs within the Local EPCs supporting IOPS operation where the Public Safety authority requires that the UE be provided service in the event of a loss of backhaul Storage of the IOPS network security credential set in the Local HSS is only performed for UEs authorised for operation in the IOPS network Administrative provisioning is used to keep up to date security credentials for all authorised UEs at the Local HSSs within the Local EPCs. Updates are provided within a security context that already exists between the EPC and eNBs in the 'normal' network This solution provides integrity and confidentiality for IOPS networks and maintains commonality with the procedures defined in this specification Furthermore, the approach is aligned with the implementation and deployment guidelines for IOPS as defined in TS 23.401 [2] F.3.1 Malicious switching of USIM applications The use of a distinct set of security credentials counteracts the possibility that malicious switching of USIM applications would permit unauthorised access to an IOPS network or to a normal PLMN. eNBs operating in IOPS mode and Local EPCs support Network Domain Control Plane protection (clause 11) and backhaul link user plane protection (clause 12) as F.3.2 Compromise of local HSSs Subscriber credentials are provisioned in all Local HSSs within the Local EPCs supporting IOPS operation where the Public Safety authority requires that the UE be provided service in the event of a loss of backhaul communication. If one of these local HSSs was compromised by an attacker either in the form that the attacker could obtain the subscriber credentials or that the attacker could control the interface to the local HSS, and if, for any given subscriber, the credentials in the local HSSs were the same, this would imply that, for all subscribers whose credentials were stored in the compromised local HSS, the USIMs out in the field would have to be swapped and the subscriber credentials would have to be re provisioned in all local HSS The following clause F.4 describes a mechanism, termed 'subscriber key separation' that would mitigate the effects of a compromise of a local HSS as described in the preceding paragraph F.4 Mitigation of compromise of a local HSS The text in the present clause is informative as the described mechanism is completely transparent to MEs, eNBs, MMEs, and, for local HSSs, requires only configuration changes in the local Authentication Centres. The corresponding configuration capability is already available in AuCs today The mechanism does require functional changes to UICCs, but not to the UICC ME interface. As both UICC and local Authentication Centre are under the control of one operator, the configuration in the local Authentication Centre and the functional changes to UICCs can be implemented without any normative changes to existing 3GPP specifications. However, normative changes to UICC specifications are not precluded by the present text F.4.1 'Subscriber key separation' mechanism For each subscriber, there is a subscriber master key MK for IOPS purposes. This master key MK is stored in the UICC, but not in any local HSS. Assume that there are N local HSSs, HSS_1, ..., HSS_N. As part of the provisioning process for local HSS_n (1<=n<=N), a key K_n is derived from MK using a suitable representation of n as input, so that all K_n are different and the knowledge of K_n does neither allow inferring knowledge about MK nor about any K_m with m different from n An example of a suitable key derivation function is given further below in clause F.4.2. Each local HSS_n is then provisioned with the Identification of a local HSS A local HSS is identified by a number n between 1 and N. We assume here that N<256. If this assumption does not hold then a grouping into subclasses is used, as described in the next clause. The number n is represented by 8 bits, bit ""0"" to bit ""7"". The representation of n draws on the proprietary part of the Authentication Management Field (AMF), cf. Annex H of TS 33.102 [4], in the following way Bits ""0"" to ""7"" of n: The IOPS operator chooses a subset of the proprietary bits ""8"" to ""15"" of the AMF to be used in order to address his N local HSSs, and then informs the UICC vendor of his choice of AMF bits. Bits that are not in this subset are set to zero in the representation of n. For a given local HSS, the IOPS operator selects a specific combination of the chosen AMF bits, which is the same for all subscribers, and maps them to the bit position k-8 in the representation of n when k is the position of the bit in the AMF. It needs to be ensured by agreement between local HSS vendor and UICC vendor (following operator requirements) that the AMF bits chosen for IOPS purposes are not used for any other purpose An example of the use of these AMF bits for IOPS purposes is as follows Assume that there are 50 local HSSs (i.e. N=50) and the IOPS operator uses bit 10 of the AMF for a proprietary purpose. By way of example bit ""9"" and bits ""11"" to ""15"" of the AMF are chosen for IOPS purposes which would allow addressing 64 local HSSs Let us assume that the maximum number of local HSSs that can be uniquely addressed through the use of the selected AMF bits is L. (If all 8 bits are used, L=256). In case the number N of local HSSs is greater than or equal to L then the local HSSs can be grouped into M subclasses where M<L. In each subclass, the subscriber credential K_n would be the same for a given subscriber. In this way, the impact of a compromise of one local HSS would be limited to the local HSSs in one subclass, and only the local HSSs of this subclass would need to be reconfigured. I.e this would greatly reduce the impact of a compromise from N local HSSs to N/M local HSSs. There would still be no need for exchanging the NOTE: If the available bits of the AMF are not sufficient to assign a unique ID to an IOPS operator's local HSSs, the representation of n may draw on an additional source: the IND part of the sequence number SQN, as described in Annex C.1 of TS 33.102. It is recommended to only draw on the bits in the AMF, and not use the IND part of the sequence number SQN, if the available AMF bits suffice to identify the local HSSs The run of an EPS AKA procedure in the presence of the subscriber key separation mechanism is identical to that without the presence of the mechanism, except for the operation of the USIM application on the UICC dedicated to IOPS. The modified operation is described as follows whenever the UICC receives an AUTHENTICATE command from the ME that is destined towards the USIM dedicated to IOPS, the USIM dedicated to IOPS first checks the AMF bits chosen for IOPS purposes and determines whether the local HSS uses the subscriber key separation mechanism and if so, what is the number n of the local HSS. The USIM dedicated to IOPS then proceeds to derive K_n from MK. The key K_n then takes the role of the permanent subscriber key K, and EPS AKA proceeds as described in the present specification and in TS 31.102 [4], with K_n replacing K in all computations F.4.2 Key derivation mechanism for 'subscriber key separation' The key derivation (including input parameter encoding) for deriving K_n from MK is performed using the key derivation function (KDF) specified in Annex A.17 of the present specification One of the input parameters f(n) to the KDF in Annex A.17 is obtained by applying a function f to n. The function f is realised as a table in the IOPS dedicated USIM. The parameter P0 in Annex A.17 corresponds to the value indexed by n in the table. The table in the USIM needs to be updated by OTA (Over-The-Air) means in case a local HSS is compromised, cf. clause An example realisation of a function f could take the following form: f(n) = n || m, where m is an 8-bit representation of a number between 0 and 255 and n || m is the concatentation of the bit representations of n and m Initially, all m values are set to zero. When there is a need to update the table, due to a compromise of the local HSS with number n, then the value m for this n will be increased by 1. So, over time, the m-values for different n may differ. This table allows a UE to calculate the key K_n as the UE moves from one local HSS to another. If a local HSS is compromised its keys cannot be updated until OTA communications with the macro-HSS are resumed. In that case, the UEs can be notified to update the relevant m value in their tables; the UEs can then re-calculate the new key for any compromised HSS without the necessity for OTA updates of the whole table The circumstances in which the whole table is re-initialized will be determined by the individual operator NOTE: The advantage of using f(n), instead of n directly, as input to the KDF is that n can be re-allocated after a compromise of a local HSS once the table has been updated. The update of the table would mean a modification of the value in the table that is indexed by n F.5 Actions in case of compromise of a local HSS In case of a compromise of one local HSS, other local HSSs are not affected (because they have a different set of secrets and it is assumed that an attacker knowing K_n cannot use this information to retrieve the corresponding IOPS master subscriber key). Furthermore, there is no need for swapping all USIMs, only the compromised local HSS (or the local HSSs in the subclass sharing the same subscriber key, cf. NOTE above) needs to be newly provisioned with keys derived from the MK and a newly provisioned value in the table of the IOPS dedicated USIM Action can, of course, only be taken, after the compromise of a local HSS was detected. But even before detection of the compromise, the subscriber key separation mechanism ensures that the attacker can neither use the compromised key K_n to impersonate the subscriber towards another local IOPS network nor impersonate another local IOPS network towards the subscriber. Therefore, the mechanism is useful even before new provisioning has taken place. But the attacker can impersonate the local IOPS network towards the subscriber until revocation has taken place NOTE 1: Sequence number handling: One of the tasks of a USIM application is handling sequence numbers for the AKA protocol (cf. TS 33.401 which refers to TS 33.102 for this purpose). Often, an array is used as specified in TS 33.102, Annex C. The USIM dedicated exclusively for IOPS may use the same array for all keys K_n and increase a sequence number as if the authentication challenge came from a single HSS (instead of from several local HSSs as in the present use case). Protection against replay of challenges continues to be guaranteed as the USIM then records all sequence numbers sent by any of the local HSSs that have been successfully NOTE 2: Re-synchronisation: When a UE moves from one local HSS to the next one, it could happen that the second local HSS generates authentication vectors with a sequence number that is too low as seen from the USIM with the added functions. This would then result in a re-synchronisation procedure that would be successful as the AUTS parameter in the re-synchronisation procedure causes the local HSS to update its sequence number and consequently generate an authentication vector that will be accepted by the USIM. This would then result in a successful Attach procedure, albeit at the expense of some added delay. If the delay is a concern and re synchronisation procedures may be frequent due to frequent movements of UEs between local HSSs then this problem could be almost completely solved by using the IND value of the sequence number, cf. Annex C of TS 33.102 [4], to distinguish among local HSSs, i.e. set up the local HSSs such that they use only particular LTE - WLAN aggregation This clause describes the security functions necessary to support an UE that is simultaneously connected to an eNB and a WT for LTE-WLAN Aggregation as described in TS 36.300 [30] The LWA architecture is shown in Figure G.1-1 Figure G.1-1 LWA architecture For LTE-WLAN Aggregation the end-points of encryption remain at the respective PDCP layers of the eNB and the UE, even though the PDCP packets traverse a different path via the WLAN Access Network The WT is the termination point of the WLAN Access Network facing the eNB The UE-WT link needs to be secured to protect the PDCP and the WLAN signalling in the eNB from possible attacks Security requirements for this protection are given below 1) The UE-WT link shall be integrity and confidentiality protected 2) Xw interface: Control plane (Xw-C) and User plane (Xw-U) need to be integrity protected. User plane (Xw-U) encryption between eNB and WT may NOT be needed since PDCP packets are already encrypted Sub clauses below describe how these requirements are met G.2 LTE-WLAN aggregation security G.2.1 Protection of the WLAN Link between the UE and the WT The WLAN communication established between the WLAN AP and the UE shall be protected using the IEEE 802.11[39] security mechanisms. The security key for protecting the over the air WLAN link is computed from the current UE eNB security context. Security protection within the WLAN network between WT and WLAN AP is out of scope for 3GPP When the eNB initially establishes LWA with the UE through a WT for a given AS security context shared between the MeNB and the UE, the eNB generates the S-KWT for the WT and sends it to the WT over the Xw. The same S-KWT is also generated by the UE To generate the S-KWT, the eNB shall use a counter, called a WT Counter The WT Counter shall be incremented for every new computation of the S-KWT as described in the clause G.2.4. The WT Counter is used as freshness input into S-KWT derivation as described in the clause G.2.4, and guarantees together with the other provisions in the present clause G, that the same S KWT is not re-used with the same input parameters as defined in Annex B of the present specification. The latter would result in key-stream re-use The eNB shall send the value of the WT Counter to the UE over the RRC signalling path when it is required to generate a new S-KWT To establish WLAN security, the UE and WT shall use the key S-KWT as equivalent to either the PMK or PSK defined in IEEE 802.11 specification To use S-KWT as PMK, the UE shall initialize the PMKSA described in [39] clause11.5.1.1.2 with PMKID set to Truncate-128(HMAC-SHA-256(PMK, ""PMK Name"" || AA || SPA)), where AA = WLAN AP MAC address and SPA = UE MAC address andstart the 4-way handshake on the WLAN link between the UE and the WLAN AP by sending association request with PMKID Information Element included in the request. In case PMKID is not found at the WLAN AP (e.g, AP is not collocated with the WT or AP does not support receipt of S-KWT from WT and initialization of PMKSA), the AP may start EAP authentication by sending EAP Identity Request. A method for the UE and the WT to install PMK and initialize PMKSA from S-KWT at such a WLAN AP is described in clause To use S-KWT as PSK, the WT should support PSK AKMs suites 2 and 6 described in [39] clause 9.4.2.25.3. The UE should use the PSK to start the NOTE: The combination of UE WLAN MAC address and exposure of the IMSI in the same context could impact user privacy. It is left to the implementation to mitigate the UE privacy risk, subject to G.2.2 Protection of the Xw interface The control plane signalling between eNB and WT over the Xw interface, that includes the transfer of the S-KWT and the MAC address (i.e. the UE Identity as described in TS 36.463 [40]) used to identify the S-KWT in the the WT from the eNB to the WT, shall be confidentiality and integrity protected using security protection as described in clause 5.3.4a and clause 11of the present specification. Any user plane data between eNB and WT over Xw interface shall be allowed only for authenticated UEs G.2.3 Addition, modification and release of DRBs in LWA When executing the WT Addition procedure (i.e. the initial offload of one or more radio bearers to the WT), or the WT Modification procedure requiring an update of S-KWT, the eNB shall derive an S-KWT as defined in clause G.2.4. The eNB shall forward the generated S-KWT to the WT during the WT Addition procedure or WT Modification procedure requiring key update. When offloading additional bearers to a WT after the initial offload, the S-KWT does not need to be refreshed NOTE: Refer to TS 36.300 [30] for definition of the LWA procedures The UE shall derive the S-KWT as described in clause G.2.4 eNB releases the LWA through a WT Release procedure. Upon LWA Release Requestmessage to WT and Release LWA Configuration message to UE from eNB both UE and WT shall release the WLAN path and delete the S-KWT key and the G.2.4 Derivation of keys for the DRBs in LWA G.2.4.1 WT Counter maintenance The eNB shall associate a 16-bit counter, WT Counter, with the EPS AS The WT Counter is used when computing the S-KWT. The UE and the eNB shall treat the WT Counter as a fresh input to S-KWT derivation. That is, the UE assumes that the eNB provides a fresh WT Counter for each S-KWT derivation and does not need to verify the freshness of the WT Counter NOTE: The value of the WT Counter is integrity and replay protected when sent over the air in the RRC signaling, and so force re-use of the same WT Counter and computation of the same S-KWT is prevented. The eNB maintains the value of the counter WT Counter for a duration of the current AS security context between UE and eNB. The UE does not need to maintain the WT Counter after it has computed the S-KWT since the eNB provides the UE with the current WT Counter value when the UE needs to compute a new S-KWT The eNB that supports the LWA DRB offload shall initialize the WT Counter to '0' when the KeNB in the associated AS security context is established The eNB shall set the WT Counter to '1' after the first calculated S-KWT and monotonically increment it for each additional calculated S-KWT. The WT Counter value '0' is hence used to calculate the first S-KWT If the eNB decides to turn off the LWA offload connection and later decides to re-start the offloading to the same WT, the WT Counter value shall keep increasing, thus keeping the computed S-KWT fresh The eNB shall refresh the KeNB of the AS security context associated with the WT Counter before the WT Counter wraps around. Re-freshing the KeNB is done using intra cell handover procedure as described in clause 7.2.9.3 of the present specification. When this KeNB is refreshed, the WT Counter is reset to '0' as defined above G.2.4.2 Security key derivation The UE and eNB shall derive the security key S-KWT of the target WT as defined in Annex A.18 of the present specification Figure G.2.4.2-1 S-KWT computation G.2.5 Security key update G.2.5.1 Security key update triggers The system supports update of the S-KWT. The eNB may update the S-KWT for any reason by using the S-KWT update procedure defined in clause G.2. 5.2 of the current specification. If the eNB re-keys its currently active KeNB in an AS security context, the eNB may update any S-KWT associated with that AS security context G.2.5.2 Security key update procedures If the eNB decides to perform S-KWT update (see clause G.2.5.1), the eNB shall increment the WT Counter and compute a fresh S-KWT, as defined in clause G.2.4. Then the eNB shall perform a WT Modification procedure to deliver the fresh S-KWT to the WT. The eNB shall provide the value of the WT Counter used in the derivation of the S-KWT to the UE in an integrity protected RRC message. The UE shall derive the S-KWT as described in clause The UE and WT shall start using a fresh S-KWT when subsequent WLAN authentication is triggered. If there are multiple S-KWT keys at the UE and the WT, the latest S-KWT shall be used. Whenever the UE or WT start using a fresh S-KWT as PMK they shall refresh the IEEE 802.11 security NOTE: In certain abnormal scenarios (e.g., the eNB detects there is mismatch in the PDCP Count when performing Counter Check procedure), the eNB can force the WLAN authentication of the UE by performing the WT Release procedure first and then the WT Addition procedure (see clause G.2.3) During S1 and X2 handover, when the LWA DRB connection between the UE and the WT is released, the UE shall delete the S-KWT and further keys derived During or after handover where the LWA configuration is retained through the same WT as explained in clause 10.1.2.2 of TS 36.300[30], the UE may keep two sets of PDCP keys corresponding to the old PDCP and new PDCP until an end marker packet is received from the source eNB After the UE receives the ""end-marker packet"", any received PDCP PDUs whose COUNT value is larger than the COUNT value corresponding to the Sequence Number in the ""end-marker packet"" shall be discarded G.2.7 Periodic local authentication procedure The eNB terminates the PDCP for control plane and user plane for the UE Hence, the periodic local authentication procedure can be performed between UE and eNB as described in clause 7.5 also for the case the PDCP packets that traverse the WLAN link G.2.8 LTE and WLAN link failure Connectivity can fail on the WLAN side as well as on the LTE side. In both cases, when WLAN or LTE link failure is discovered, the UE shall delete the S-KWT, the eNB shall indicate to the WT to delete the S-KWT G.3 Method for installing PMK An existing IEEE 802.1x compliant AP may not support receiving S-KWT from WT and using it as the PMK. In order to support LWA with existing WLAN deployments with such APs, the UE and the WT may leverage the existing EAP authentication procedures at the AP to install PMK and create PMKSA. A 3GPP vendor specific EAP authentication method for LWA, herein after referred to as EAP-LWA, is described in this clause NOTE: In order to use EAP-LWA as a vendor specific EAP method, the existing 3GPP Vendor-Id of 10415 registered with IANA under the SMI Private Enterprise Code registry is used. The Vendor-Type ID is specified in Annex C of TS 33.402 [41] In this method, the WT maintains an association of the current UEs instructed to use LWA offloading by an eNB, and the assigned S-KWT for that UE. A new UE identity called the LWA-ID is used to identify the UE to the WT and is derived as shown in step 3 of figure G.1-1 and is known by the UE and WT. If the WLAN AP does not have the PMK (S-KWT), upon receipt of EAP Identity Request message from the WLAN AP, the UE sends an EAP-Identity Response message to the AP with an NAI with realm portion including the identifier of the WT where the S-KWT can be found and the LWA-ID as the user portion of the NAI. The AP routes the EAP-Identity Response message to the WT identified by the realm. Upon receipt and successful identification of the UE, the WT initiates EAP-Request Challenge to the UE to perform successful EAP authentication between the UE and WLAN AP and the installation of the PMK at the WLAN AP 1) When eNB wants to start LWA for the UE, it sends WT Addition Request to the WT. This request includes the UE MAC address and the S-KWT 2) WT acknowledges the receipt of WT Addition request 3) WT sets LWA-ID to SHA256 (S-KWT, UE MAC addr, ""LWA Identity"") and associates with the received S-KWT 4) After receiving command from eNB to start LWA and deriving S-KWT, the UE derives PMKID as specified in clause G.2.1 5) UE includes the PMKID in the WLAN Association Request 6) The PMKSA associated with PMKID is not found at the WLAN AP 7) The WLAN AP responds with WLAN Association Response, omitting the PMKID that is not found at the AP 8) WLAN AP initiates EAP authentication 9) WLAN AP sends EAP-Identity Request message 10) The UE responds with EAP-Identity Response message with the LWA ID@realm as the UE identity for EAP-LWA. The LWA-ID and realm are set LWA-ID = SHA256 (S-KWT, UE MAC addr, ""LWA Identity"") realm = lwa.wtid<WTID>.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>. 3gppnetwork.org WTID = E-UTRAN Cell Identity (ECI) of eNB MNC = MNC of Serving Network PLMN Identity MCC = MCC of Serving Network PLMN Identity 11) WLAN AP uses the realm and routes the EAP-Identity response to WT as 12) WT uses LWA-ID to locate the S-KWT. If LWA-ID is not found, the WT sends EAP-Failure message, terminating the WLAN associtation 13) WT initiates EAP-LWA, by sending AAA EAP-Request/LWA-Challenge message, by including a 128-bit random nonce, ASNonce 14) AP forwards the EAP-Request/LWA-Challenge message to the UE 15) UE selects a 128-bit random nonce, STANonce, and derives AUTHRES and AUTHRES = SHA256 (S-KWT, ASNonce, STANonce, ""LWA AUTHRES"") MSK = SHA256 (S-KWT, ASNonce, STANonce, ""LWA MSK Key Derivation"") 16) UE sends EAP-Response/LWA-Challenge message with STANonce and 17) WLAN AP forwards the EAP-Response/LWA-Challenge AAA message to WT 18) WT derives AUTHRES and MSK as specified in step 15) and compares it with the received AUTHRES. If they are same, EAP-LWA authentication is successful, and proceeds to step 19). Otherwise EAP-Failure message is sent, terminating WLAN association procedure 19) WT sends EAP-Success with MSK as AAA message to WLAN AP 20) WLAN AP sends EAP-Success 21) Upon receiving EAP-Success, the UE and WLAN AP perform 4-way handshake and complete WLAN association 22) WT sends WT Association Confirm message to the eNB, confirming successful WLAN association of the UE. Note that WT may send this message anytime after step 19) LTE-WLAN RAN level integration using IPsec tunnelling This clause describes the security functions necessary to support LTE-WLAN integration using IPsec tunnelling as described in TS 36.300 [30] The LTE-WLAN integration architecture is shown in Figure H.1-1 and the protocol stack in Figure H.1-2 For LTE-WLAN integration using IPsec tunnelling the integration happens using PDCP SDUs above the PDCP layer. The eNB controls activation of the integration based on the UE connectivity with a specific WLAN. Once the integration is activated, the eNB segregates incoming DL packets towards the UE for offloading via the WLAN at a layer above PDCP. The UL packets from the UE are aggregated by the eNB at the same logical point Since PDCP security is bypassed for the data routed through the WLAN and security of the legacy WLAN is not assumed, security for the PDCP SDUs and protection of the operator network shall be achieved in the following way - A LWIP-SeGW shall be placed between the eNB and the WLAN network for security of packets that traverse WLAN and to protect the Operator's - The interface between the eNB and the LWIP-SeGW shall be confidentiality and integrity protected by NDS/IP TS 33.210 [36] - An UE-specific IPsec security association tunnel shall be established between the UE and the public IP port of the LWIP-SeGW in tunnel mode - In addition to terminating IPsec from the UE, the LWIP-SeGW shall perform rate limitation for DoS protection on the eNB and its backhaul - UEs, including authenticated and authorized UEs using LWIP, shall not have IP connectivity to the eNB - IP headers created by the UE in LTE WLAN integration using IPsec tunnelling shall not be parsed by the eNB - The UE and the LWIP-SeGW function shall perform mutual authentication in the phase 2 of the IKEv2 handshake during the IPsec tunnel establishment, using the authentication key derived from the current AS - The LWIP-SeGW shall enforce binding of an authenticated UE to its IP address, and apply anti-spoofing measures on received packets for the UE's outer and inner IP source address(es) - The LWIP-SeGW shall ensure that uplink traffic sent by a UE is only sent towards the correct eNB by conveying the traffic to a GTP-U tunnel In addition, before the IPsec tunnel is established between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW, and before the offload can be performed, the UE needs to obtain IP connectivity across the WLAN network, which may require an access authentication independent of the EPC authentication, and is outside the scope of this specification H.2 Security of LTE-WLAN integration using IPsec Tunnelling H.2.1 eNB to UE interaction for setting up the LWIP offload When the eNB initially establishes LWIP with the UE, the eNB and the UE shall generate the LWIP security key, LWIP-PSK, as specified in clause H.4 to be used as the PSK for the IPsec tunnel set up between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW, as described in clause H.2.2 The eNB shall provide to the UE, over the secure RRC signalling, the - IP address of the LWIP-SeGW for the IKEv2 handshake - The Initiator Identity value, IDi, that the UE shall use in the IKEv2 - LWIP counter that the UE shall use in LWIP-PSK derivation H.2.2 UE to LWIP-SeGW interaction for setting up the LWIP offload LTE-WLAN integration (LWIP) over legacy WLAN is secured using an IPSec in a tunnel mode established between the UE, via the WLAN, and the LWIP-SeGW function. The IPsec in tunnel mode is established using the IKEv2 handshake based on the pre-shared key, PSK as specified in IETF RFC 7296 [38]. The UE and LWIP-SeGW shall use the LWIP-PSK as the PSK for authentication in the second phase of IKEv2 In the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW, the inner IP addresses shall be identical to the outer IP addresses. I.e., in UL the source IP address shall be the IP address of the UE in the WLAN network and the destination IP address shall be the public IP address of the SeGW, and in DL the source IP address shall be the public IP address of the SeGW and the destination IP address shall be the IP address of the UE in the WLAN If the UE is located behind a NAT, the following will hold for the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW - In UL between the UE and the NAT, the source IP address will be the local address of the UE in the WLAN - In DL between the LWIP-SeGW and the NAT, the destination IP address will be the public IP address under which the UE located behind the NAT - The NAT will then overwrite the address of the UE in the outer IP When conducting the IKEv2 handshake, the UE shall use the value of IDi and the IP address of the LWIP-SeGW received from the eNB The LWIP-SeGW shall use the received value of IDi to locate the NOTE2: To improve the DoS protection of the public IP port of the LWIP SeGW, the LWIP-SeGW function can expect initiation of the IKEv2 handshake from the UE for a limited time window, based on a configuration. After expiration of this window, the LWIP-SeGW function can delete the LWIP-PSK and associated IDi, and rejects any IKEv2 handshake initiations After successful completion of the IKEv2 handshake, the LWIP-SeGW and the UE shall store the LWIP-PSK. When the IKEv2 SA is deleted, the LWIP-SeGW and the UE shall delete the LWIP-PSK For LWIP offloaded traffic, the eNB shall only be reachable through the The LWIP-SeGW shall allow communication of the UE only to the eNB that initiated the LWIP offload, and only to the interface on this eNB allowed for the LWIP offload The profiles for IKEv2 and IPsec ESP as defined in TS 33.210 [36] shall be H.2.3 eNB to LWIP-SeGW interaction for setting the LWIP offload The PDCP SDUs between the eNB and LWIP SeGW shall be encapsulated in a tunnelling protocol as specified in TS 36.300 [30] in order to avoid that the eNB needs to interpret IP packets coming from the UE The eNB shall inform the LWIP-SeGW function of the expected initiation of IKEv2 handshake by a UE, for subsequent establishment of the IPsec, and provide the following parameters - the Initiator ID value, (IDi) that the UE will use in the IKEv2 The standardized Xw interface between the eNB and the LWIP-SeGW is specified in TS 36.300 [30] and it shall be confidentiality and integrity protected by NDS/IP TS 33.210 [36] H.3 Addition and modification of DRB in LTE-WLAN integration All DRBs a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sociated with the same UE and routed through WLAN shall use the same IPSec tunnel established between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW function The eNB manages the DRB addition and deletion as specified in TS 36.300 [30]. When the last DRB between the eNB and UE is deleted, the eNB shall instruct the LWIP-SeGW and the UE to release the IPsec tunnel H.4 Security Key for IKEv2 handshake H.4.0 LWIP counter maintenance The eNB shall associate a 16-bit counter, LWIP counter, with the EPS AS The LWIP counter is used when computing the LWIP-PSK for the IPSec tunnel set up. The UE and the eNB shall treat the LWIP counter as a fresh input to LWIP-PSK derivation. That is, the UE assumes that the eNB provides a fresh LWIP counter for each LWIP-PSK derivation and does not need to verify the freshness of the LWIP counter The eNB maintains the value of the LWIP counter for a duration of the current AS security context between UE and eNB. The UE does not need to maintain the LWIP counter after it has computed the LWIP-PSK since the eNB provides the UE with the current LWIP counter value when the UE needs to compute a new LWIP-PSK The eNB that supports the LWIP shall initialize the LWIP counter to '0' when the KeNB in the associated AS security context is established or refreshed. The eNB shall monotonically increment the LWIP counter for each subsequent calculation of the LWIP-PSK If the eNB decides to turn off the LWIP and instruct the termination of the IPSec tunnel and later decides to re-start the LWIP using IPSec tunnel without updating the KeNB, the LWIP counter value shall keep increasing thus keeping the computed LWIP-PSK fresh The eNB shall refresh the KeNB of the AS security context associated with the LWIP counter before the LWIP counter wraps around. Re-freshing the KeNB is done using intra cell handover procedure as described in clause 7.2.9.3 of the present specification H.4.1 Security Key (LWIP-PSK) Derivation The UE and eNB shall derive the security key LWIP-PSK for the IPsec tunnel set up as shown on the Fig.H.4.1-1 and defined in Annex A.16 of the present H.4.2 Security key (LWIP-PSK) update The eNB may update the LWIP-PSK for any reason by releasing the IPSec tunnel and restarting it in the following way . The eNB shall instruct the LWIP-SeGW function to release the current IPSec tunnel, and provide a new LWIP-PSK to support establishment of the new IPsec tunnel. The eNB shall instruct the UE over the RRC signaling to re-initiate the IKEv2 using the new LWIP-PSK to establish a new IPsec tunnel During S1 and X2 handover, the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP SeGW shall be released. The eNB shall instruct the LWIP-SeGW and the UE to release the IPsec. Both the LWIP-SeGW and the UE shall delete the LWIP-PSK H.6 LWIP radio link failure When a LTE radio link failure is detected, the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP SeGW shall be released, either by the eNB informing the LWIP SeGW of this event, or at the UE. Both the LWIP-SeGW and the UE shall If the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the LWIP-SeGW is released due to WLAN connectivity issues, a fresh LWIP IPsec tunnel set up may be performed when WLAN wireless connectivity is restored This Annex describes how to form the inputs of non-keyed hash calculations using the KDF described in TS 33.220 [8] I.2 HASHMME and HASHUE When the MME and UE shall derive HASHMME and HASHUE respectively using the following parameters as input to the KDF given in TS 33.220 [8] - S = Unprotected ATTACH Request or TAU Request message NOTE: The order of packing the input, S, to hash algorithm is the same as the order of packing the UL NAS message to the MME - Key = 256-bit string of all 0s HASHMME or HASHUE are the 64 least significant bits of the 256 bits of the Restricted Local Operator Services (RLOS) J.1 Restricted Local Operator Services (RLOS) Restricted Local Operator Services (RLOS) is an optional feature supported in certain countries and is specified in TS 23.401 [2]. RLOS is always initiated by the UE based on explicit request from the user. Access to RLOS may be allowed for UEs in limited service state by the serving network depending on local regulation and operator policy. Allowing access to RLOS for UEs in limited service state means that there is no network authentication and in such a case further security checks need to be performed by the UE to address the potential security threats due to this lack of network authentication (i.e., EPS AKA) This Annex is not applicable for UEs accessing RLOS after performing successful EPS AKA authentication as they follow the security procedures specified in the main body of this specification J.1.2 Algorithm negotiation for unauthenticated UEs in LSM UEs that are in limited service mode (LSM) and that cannot be authenticated by the MME (for whatever reason) may still be allowed to establish RLOS calls by sending the RLOS attach request message as specified in TS 23.401 It shall be possible to configure the MME to allow unauthenticated UEs in LSM to establish bearers for RLOS calls or not. If an MME is configured to allow unauthenticated UEs in LSM to establish bearers for an RLOS call, the MME shall for the NAS protocol use EIA0 and EEA0 as the integrity and If the MME allows an unauthenticated UE in LSM to establish bearers for RLOS calls after it has received the RLOS attach request message from the UE, the MME shall - Select EIA0 and EEA0, regardless of the supported algorithms announced previously by the UE as the NAS algorithms and signal this to the UE via the NAS security mode command procedure when activating the EPS NAS - Set the UE EPS security capabilities to only contain EIA0 and EEA0 when sending these to the eNB in the following messages - S1 UE INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP - S1 UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST - S1 HANDOVER REQUEST NOTE 1: The result of the MME only sending a UE EPS security capability containing EIA0 and EEA0 to the eNB is that the eNB is only capable of selecting EIA0 for AS integrity protection and EEA0 for AS confidentiality protection. That is, if EIA0 is used for NAS integrity protection, then EIA0 will always be used for AS If the UE has initiated an RLOS connection, the UE may accept the use of EIA0 for NAS and RRC signalling protection. The UE shall also support the mitigations given in clause J.1.3 to reduce the impact of a lack of network authentication for RLOS connections J.1.3 Additional UE behaviour for RLOS connections If the UE is in LSM and wishes to initiate an RLOS connection, the ME shall perform the following checks before initiating the RLOS attach procedure 1) The ME shall enforce access control on applications that are authorized to trigger establishment of RLOS connection. Applications on the ME that are not explicitly authorized shall not be allowed to trigger the initiation of RLOS connection 2) A user confirmation shall be requested before the ME initiates RLOS connection. As part of the user confirmation, the user shall be notified of the security risk due to the lack of network 3) The ME shall maintain a white list of MCCs where RLOS is supported (i.e., by preconfiguring the white list either at the time of ME manufacturing or hardcoding). The ME shall check that the MCC of the network name that advertises RLOS service is present in the white list before initiating the RLOS connection 4) If a USIM is present, the ME shall check that the MCC part of the IMSI configured in the USIM is present in the white list of MCCs on the ME before initiating the RLOS connection If the above checks are successful, the ME shall initiate the RLOS attach procedure. If any one of the above checks fail, then the ME shall not initiate the RLOS attach procedure J.2 Recommendations for RLOS Allowing RLOS connections to the network for UEs that are in LSM means that there is no network authentication. This means that it is not possible to protect the NAS and AS traffic. RLOS services should be protected by implementing application layer security mechanisms. Such application layer security mechanisms are dependent on the RLOS service and are outside the scope of this document J.3 MCC whitelist for RLOS The whitelist for RLOS shall be: MCC = 310, MCC = 311, MCC= 312, MCC=313 MCC=314, MCC=315 and MCC = 316 This Annex provides the security procedures applied to IAB-node when connecting to EPC. The IAB reference architecture, when connected to EPC is defined in TS 23.401 [2] IAB-node consists of a gNB-DU function and a UE function (referred to as IAB-UE). The IAB-UE function reuses UE procedures defined in this document to connect to EPC In an IAB (Integrated Access and Backhaul) architecture, the IAB-node can access the network using either standalone mode or EN-DC mode. Overall description of IAB feature in standalone mode is in TS 38.300 [44]. The EN DC specific details are defined in TS 36.331 [21], TS 36.413 [42], and TS When using the EN-DC mode, as shown in Figure K.1-1, the IAB-node connects via E-UTRA to a MeNB, and the IAB-donor terminates X2-C as SgNB The present document only deals with security aspects of IAB in the EN-DC mode. The security aspects of IAB in standalone mode (including authentication and authorization of IAB-nodes, and security of F1 interfaces) are defined in TS 33.501 [43] K.2 IAB-node integration procedure K.2.1 Authentication and Authorization of IAB-node The IAB-UE function shall behave as a UE, and shall reuse the UE procedures specified in this specification, when connecting to EPC, for the authentication, key derivation and distribution scheme, subscription credential(s) storage requirements," NAS security and AS security Authorization of IAB-nodes shall be performed by the EPC supporting IAB architecture as described in TS 23.401 [2]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
