C259,,,"The following abnormal cases can be identified a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS signalling connection establishment rejected by the network without ""Extended wait time"" received from lower layers In WB-S1 mode, if the service request procedure is started in response to a paging request from the network, access class barring, EAB or ACDC is not applicable In NB-S1 mode, if the service request procedure is started in response to a paging request from the network, access barring is not applicable If the trigger for the service request procedure is the response to a paging request from the network and the NAS signalling connection establishment is rejected by the network, the service request procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. During an implementation dependent time period, the service request procedure may be started when access for ""terminating calls"" is granted or upon a cell change If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and the access is barred for ""mobile originating CS fallback"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]) and the lower layer indicates ""the barring is due to CSFB specific access barring information"", the service request procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be started if it is still necessary, i.e. when access for ""mobile originating CS fallback"" is granted or because of a cell change If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received and the access is barred for ""mobile originating CS fallback"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]) and the lower layer does not indicate ""the barring is due to CSFB specific access barring information"", the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the access is barred for ""originating calls"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), the UE shall select cdma2000 xae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000 xae 1x CS procedures If the lower layer indicated the access was barred because of access class barring for ""originating calls"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]) and if the service request is initiated due to a request from upper layers for user plane radio resources, and the MO MMTEL voice call is started, the MO MMTEL video call is started or the MO SMSoIP is started the service request is initiated due to a mobile originated SMS over NAS or SMS over S102; or the service request is initiated due to a request from upper layers for user plane radio resources, ACDC is applicable to the request and the UE supports ACDC then the service request procedure shall be started. The call type used shall be per annex D of this document NOTE 1: If more than one of MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started conditions are satisfied, it is left to UE implementation to determine the call type based on annex D of this document If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user plane radio resources for a higher ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC, then the service request procedure shall be started If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user plane radio resources for a certain ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC, then the service request procedure shall be started In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for ""originating calls"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), the service request procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be started if it is still necessary when access for ""originating calls"" is granted or because of a cell change In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for ""originating calls"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), the service request procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the service request procedure is started again after an implementation dependent time; or In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for ""originating calls"" (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]), and a request for an exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the service request procedure shall be started NOTE 2: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP S 36.331 [22]) b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection without ""Extended wait time"", without ""Extended wait time CP data"", and without redirection indication received from lower layers before the service request procedure is completed (see clause 5.6.1.4) or before SERVICE REJECT message is received If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was received, the UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall either attempt to select cdma2000 xae 1x radio access technology and proceed with appropriate cdma2000 xae 1x CS procedures. If the UE fails to select cdma2000 xae 1x radio access technology, the UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE; or set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE, and perform cell selection according to 3GPP S 36.304 [21] If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, the UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt and locally release any resources allocated for the service request procedure. For case o) in clause 5.6.1.1 the UE may retry the service request procedure a certain number of times (maximum re-attempts 5) The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED If the UE triggered the service request procedure in EMM-IDLE mode in order to obtain packet services, then the EMM sublayer shall increment the service request attempt counter, abort the procedure and release locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure. The service request counter shall not be incremented, if the service request procedure is initiated to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 15 in selected PLMN the service request is initiated in response to paging from the network; or the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP S 31.102 [17]) If the service request attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5, the UE shall start timer T3325 (see 3GPP S 24.008 [13]). Additionally if the service request was initiated for an ""originating MMTEL voice"" call type or an ""originating MMTEL video"" call type, a notification that the service request was not accepted and that timer T3325 is running shall be provided to the upper layers NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS voice call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or other implementation specific mechanisms (see 3GPP S 24.173 [13E]) The UE shall not attempt service request until expiry of timer T3325 unless the service request is initiated in response to paging from the network the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 15 in selected PLMN the service request is initiated to establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established the UE is registered in a new PLMN; or the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP S 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP S 31.102 [17]) If the service request for ""originating MMTEL voice"" call type was triggered while T3325 is running, a notification that the service request was not accepted and that timer T3325 is running shall be provided to the upper layers NOTE 4: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a CS voice call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or other implementation specific mechanisms (see 3GPP S 24.173 [13E]) NOTE 5: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified in clause 5.4.2.7 If the UE triggered the service request procedure in order to obtain services other than packet services from EMM-IDLE mode, then the EMM sublayer shall abort the procedure and release locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure If the UE triggered the service request procedure in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the EMM sublayer shall abort the procedure and consider the service request procedure with ""active"" flag set or the 1xCS fallback procedure as failed. The UE shall stay in EMM-CONNECTED mode d) T3417ext or T3417ext-mt expired If a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE If a CS fallback cancellation request was received the UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE e) SERVICE REJECT received, other EMM cause values than those treated in clause 5.6.1.5, and cases of EMM cause values #22, #25, #31 and #78 if considered as abnormal cases according to clause 5.6.1.5 If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was received, the UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000 xae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000 xae 1x CS procedures If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the UE has dual Rx/Tx configuration and supports enhanced 1xCS fallback, then upon entering EMM-IDLE mode the UE shall perform tracking area updating procedure If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, the UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt and locally release any resources allocated for the service request procedure f) Tracking area updating procedure is triggered The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt if running and perform the tracking area updating procedure. The ""active"" flag or ""signalling active"" flag shall be set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.2. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, and the CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall send the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message to the MME by using the existing NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to ""Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested"", the UE shall not initiate a new tracking area update procedure, but shall proceed with sending the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message by using the existing NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure If the UE is in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED at switch off, the detach procedure shall be performed h) Detach procedure collision EPS detach containing detach type ""re-attach required"" If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED, the UE shall take the following actions If the service request was initiated for CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM, CC and GMM specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select cdma2000 xae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000 xae 1x CS procedures; or If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, the detach procedure shall be progressed and the service request procedure shall be aborted EPS detach containing detach type ""re-attach not required"" If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED, the UE shall take the following actions If the DETACH REQUEST message contains an EMM cause other than #2 ""IMSI unknown in HSS"" or no EMM cause IE, the detach procedure shall be progressed and the service request procedure shall be aborted. Additionally, if the service request was initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, but not for CS fallback for emergency call or 1xCS fallback for emergency call, the EMM sublayer shall indicate to the MM sublayer or the cdma2000 xae upper layers that the CS fallback or 1xCS fallback procedure has failed; or If the DETACH REQUEST message contains EMM cause #2 ""IMSI unknown in HSS"", the UE will follow the procedure as described below for the detach type ""IMSI detach"" EPS detach containing detach type ""IMSI detach"" If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED, the UE shall take the following actions if the service request was initiated for SMS over NAS or CS fallback, but not for CS fallback for emergency call, the UE shall abort the service request procedure and progress the detach procedure; or otherwise the UE shall progress both procedures i) Transmission failure of SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indication with TAI change from lower layers If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the service request procedure shall be aborted to perform the tracking area updating procedure. The ""active"" flag or ""signalling active"" flag shall be set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.2. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, and the CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall send the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message to the MME by using the existing NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the UE shall restart the service request procedure unless the service request procedure is initiated for case p) or q) in clause 5.6.1.1. For case p) and q) in clause 5.6.1.1 the UE shall abort the service request procedure, enter state EMM-REGISTERED, stop timer T3417, and locally release the NAS signalling connection and any resources allocated for the service request procedure j) Transmission failure of SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indication without TAI change from lower layers The UE shall restart the service request procedure unless the service request procedure is initiated for case p) or q) in clause 5.6.1.1.
